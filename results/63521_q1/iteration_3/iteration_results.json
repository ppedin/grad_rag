This is helpful for the user to understand the limitation.\n    *   **Polite:** The opening \"I am sorry\" is courteous.\n\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   **Unhelpful:** While it explains the limitation, it doesn't offer any alternative or guidance. The user is left with no path forward.\n    *   **Assumes \"Provided Text\":** The response implies that some text *was* provided to the RAG system, and this text was insufficient. If no text was provided, this response would be confusing. The RAG system should clarify if it received input or not.\n    *   **Lacks Proactive Guidance:** It doesn't suggest what kind of information *would* be needed to construct a plot summary.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\nThe goal is to make the response more helpful and actionable, even when the primary request cannot be met.\n\n1.  **Clarify Input Status:**\n    *   If no text was provided by the user, the RAG system should acknowledge this immediately.\n    *   If text *was* provided but insufficient, it should confirm that it reviewed the text.\n\n2.  **Explain \"Plot\" in Context:**\n    *   Briefly define what constitutes a \"plot\" in storytelling (e.g., a sequence of events with a beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution, driven by characters' motivations and conflicts). This helps the user understand what the RAG system is looking for.\n\n3.  **Suggest Necessary Information:**\n    *   Tell the user what kind of input *would* enable the RAG system to provide a plot summary. This could include:\n        *   \"A narrative summary of the story.\"\n        *   \"A detailed description of the sequence of events.\"\n        *   \"Information about the main conflict and how it is resolved.\"\n        *   \"A complete text of the story.\"\n\n4.  **Offer Alternative Actions:**\n    *   If the user *did* provide text, ask if they would like the RAG system to:\n        *   \"Summarize the events listed.\"\n        *   \"Identify the main characters and their roles.\"\n        *   \"Extract any specific details you're interested in from the provided text.\"\n    *   If no text was provided, prompt the user to provide the story text or relevant details.\n\n**Example Improved Responses:**\n\n**Scenario 1: User provided text, but it was insufficient.**\n\n> \"I've reviewed the text you provided, and while it lists several events and characters, it doesn't currently form a cohesive narrative that describes the story's plot. A plot typically outlines a sequence of events, including the main conflict, rising action, climax, and resolution.\n>\n> To help me describe the plot, could you please provide a more detailed narrative summary, or the full text of the story?\n>\n> Alternatively, I can help you by:\n> *   Summarizing the individual events mentioned.\n> *   Identifying the key characters and their apparent roles.\n> *   Extracting specific details you might be looking for from the text you sent.\"\n\n**Scenario 2: User did NOT provide text.**\n\n> \"I can help you understand the plot of a story, but I need the story's text or a detailed summary first. The information I have received so far doesn't contain the story itself.\n>\n> Please provide the text of the story, or a description that includes:\n> *   The main characters and their goals.\n> *   The central conflict or problem they face.\n> *   The sequence of key events that lead to the story's conclusion.\n> *   How the conflict is resolved.\n>\n> Once you provide this information, I'll do my best to outline the plot for you.\"\n\n**Key Takeaway for Improvement:**\n\nWhen a RAG system cannot fulfill a direct request, its response should pivot from a simple \"no\" to a helpful explanation and guidance on how to achieve the user's goal. It should clarify its state (what it received, what it understood) and offer concrete next steps or alternative services.",
