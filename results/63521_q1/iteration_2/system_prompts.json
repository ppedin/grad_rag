  "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chunk size of 256 tokens appears to be a significant contributing factor to the identified issues in the GraphRAG system. Here's a critique of how this chunk size impacts graph construction and retrieval:\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (256 tokens):**\n\n1.  **Fragmented Narrative Context:** A chunk size of 256 tokens is relatively small. In narrative texts, crucial plot points, character interactions, and causal relationships often span beyond this token limit. Splitting the text into such small chunks means that a single event or a connected sequence of actions might be broken across multiple chunks. When the LLM extracts graphs from these fragmented chunks, it likely captures only a partial view of the relationships. This leads to:\n    *   **Incomplete Relationship Extraction:** An LLM processing a 256-token chunk might identify entities and some local relationships, but it lacks the broader context to understand how these relate to events in preceding or succeeding chunks. For instance, a character's motivation or the consequence of an action might be detailed across the boundary of two chunks, rendering the extracted relationship incomplete or even misleading within a single chunk's graph.\n    *   **Atomized Knowledge:** The graph becomes a collection of very localized, disconnected \"mini-graphs\" representing isolated snippets of the story. The narrative flow, which is essential for understanding a plot, is severely disrupted because the connections that would link these snippets are not present within any single chunk.\n\n2.  **Weak Inter-Chunk Connectivity:** For a plot summary, understanding how different parts of the story connect is paramount. With small chunks, the relationships that bridge these chunks are less likely to be captured by the graph extraction LLM for *any* single chunk. This results in a graph where:\n    *   **Limited Cross-Referencing:** The LLM agent's exploration functions (e.g., accessing neighbors) will likely yield sparse results. If a key event or character action is described across two chunks, the graph extracted from chunk A might not contain nodes or relationships that directly link to information in chunk B, and vice-versa. This hinders the agent's ability to trace narrative threads.\n    *   **Loss of Global Context:** The \"global view\" of the story, which a larger chunk size could potentially preserve by encompassing more narrative context, is lost. This makes it difficult for the system to synthesize a coherent plot summary.\n\n3.  **Overemphasis on Local Details:** A small chunk size might lead to an over-extraction of very specific, local details within each chunk, while missing the overarching narrative structure. This results in a graph with many \"s\" nodes (as observed) representing perhaps individual words or very granular concepts, rather than higher-level plot elements. The graph then becomes dominated by these low-level entities, making it harder to identify key characters, plot drivers, and their significant interactions.\n\n**Recommendation for Chunk Size:**\n\nA larger chunk size (e.g., 512-1024 tokens, or even larger depending on LLM context windows and the narrative density of the text) would likely be more beneficial. This would allow the LLM to process more contiguous narrative segments, capturing more complete events, character motivations, and inter-chunk relationships. This richer, more connected local information would then enable the LLM agent to perform more meaningful graph traversals and construct a coherent plot summary.",
  "graph_builder_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the provided graph construction prompt, focusing on areas for improvement to enhance graph quality for plot-centric queries:\n\n**Critique of the Graph Construction Prompt:**\n\nThe current prompt, while aiming to extract entities and relationships, suffers from several shortcomings that lead to the problematic graph structure observed. The primary issues are:\n\n1.  **Overly Broad Relationship Definitions:** The prompt asks for \"all the relationships among the identified entities\" without providing specific examples or constraints on their semantic richness. This leads to the generation of numerous generic relationships like \"associated with,\" \"is a,\" and even the uninformative \"relationship.\" The lack of specificity means these connections offer little actionable insight for understanding plot progression.\n\n2.  **Lack of Guidance on Entity Types:** While some example entity types are given (Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept), the prompt doesn't strongly emphasize the *importance* of specific types like \"Event\" or \"Action.\" The resulting graph being dominated by \"Location\" and \"Person\" nodes suggests that narrative-driving events are not being adequately identified and categorized as distinct entities.\n\n3.  **Insufficient Emphasis on Plot-Relevant Semantics:** The prompt focuses on identifying *any* relationship, rather than prioritizing relationships crucial for narrative understanding. There's no instruction to identify relationships that indicate causality, sequence, motivation, conflict, or resolution â€“ key components of a plot. This results in a graph that describes static states more than dynamic storytelling.\n\n4.  **Potential for Redundancy and Ambiguity:** Without explicit instructions to disambiguate or consolidate, the LLM is free to generate similar but slightly varied relationship types (e.g., \"attacks\" vs. \"attacked by\"). This leads to an explosion of low-frequency, overlapping relationship types, making analysis difficult. The prompt doesn't guide the LLM towards a consistent and hierarchical ontology of relationships.\n\n5.  **Insufficient Prompting for \"Why\":** While the prompt asks for a \"description (why you think the two entities are related to each other),\" this is often a weak point in LLM outputs and can be easily satisfied with superficial reasoning. The prompt could be enhanced by explicitly asking for *causal*, *temporal*, or *purposeful* explanations for relationships.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n*   **Mandate Specific, Semantic Relationship Types:** Provide a curated list of desired relationship types that capture plot elements (e.g., `causes`, `precedes`, `motivates`, `conflict_with`, `resolves`, `discovers`, `travels_to`). Instruct the LLM to *only* use these or similar specific types, penalizing generic ones.\n*   **Prioritize \"Event\" and \"Action\" Entities:** Explicitly instruct the LLM to identify and extract key narrative events or actions as distinct entities of type \"Event\" or \"Action.\" Define relationships that link these events to involved characters and locations.\n*   **Focus on Narrative Causality and Sequence:** Modify the prompt to specifically ask for relationships that define cause-and-effect or temporal order between entities and events.\n*   **Enforce Relationship Consolidation:** Instruct the LLM to use consistent naming conventions and to avoid generating redundant or overly similar relationship types. For example, specify how to handle active vs. passive voice or different nuances of interaction.\n*   **Strengthen the \"Description/Evidence\" Requirement:** Require the description of relationships to explicitly state the *plot function* or *narrative significance* of the connection, rather than just a textual justification.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the prompt can guide the LLM to generate a graph that is more structured, semantically rich, and directly conducive to answering plot-centric queries.",
  "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the retrieval plans for the query \"What is the plot of the story?\":\n\n**Critique:**\n\nThe current retrieval plans are ineffective for answering the query \"What is the plot of the story?\". The plans are overly focused on broad searches (e.g., searching for all nodes, searching for the keyword 'story') without a clear strategy to identify narrative flow or causal relationships.\n\n1.  **Lack of Relational Focus:** The core problem is the failure to prioritize exploring relationships between entities. A plot is fundamentally about *what happens* and *how entities interact*. The current approach of searching for nodes by keyword or type, or even listing all nodes, provides a static overview of entities but does not reveal the sequence of events, character actions, or their consequences. The query explicitly asks for a *plot*, which requires dynamic, relational information.\n\n2.  **No Strategy for Narrative Construction:** The plans do not outline a method for stitching together information to form a narrative. Simply retrieving nodes related to \"story\" or listing all nodes will result in a disconnected set of facts. There's no plan to identify key actors, their motivations, the sequence of their actions, or the outcomes, which are essential components of a plot.\n\n3.  **Inefficient Use of Graph Structure:** The available tools (like `get_neighbors`, `analyze_path`, `search_relations_by_type`) are designed to explore graph connectivity. The current plans do not leverage these functions effectively. For instance, instead of a generic search, a better approach might involve identifying central \"Person\" or \"Group\" nodes and then exploring their direct relationships and neighbors to understand their interactions and roles in the narrative.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relationship Exploration:** The retrieval prompt should guide the agent to actively seek out and analyze *relationships* that indicate events or interactions. Functions like `search_relations_by_type` or starting with `get_neighbors` on prominent entities (identified by type, like \"Person\" or \"Group\") would be more effective.\n\n2.  **Focus on Narrative Elements:** The prompt should encourage the agent to look for relationship types that are indicative of plot progression. Examples include \"travels to\", \"attacks\", \"interacted with\", \"intends to rescue\", \"killed\", etc. These should be prioritized over general entity searches.\n\n3.  **Develop a Pathfinding Strategy:** For a plot, identifying sequences of events is crucial. The prompt should suggest using `analyze_path` or iteratively using `get_neighbors` to trace connections that form a logical chain of events. This could involve identifying a starting event or character and following a trail of related actions.\n\n4.  **Iterative Refinement based on Relationships:** If initial searches for relationships don't yield a clear plot, the agent should be prompted to refine its search by looking at the *types* of relationships found and using that information to guide further exploration (e.g., if \"attacked\" relationships are found, explore the involved entities further).",
  "answer_generation_critique": "Here's a critique of the current prompt and suggestions for improvement, focusing on the feedback provided:\n\n**Critique of Current Prompt:**\n\nThe current prompt is very generic:\n\n```\nYou will be given a query and the information retrieved from a graph.\nYour goal is to use the retrieved context to answer the query.\n\nThis is the query:\n{}\n\nThis is the information:\n{}\n\nProvide an answer to the query.\n```\n\nWhile it sets a basic goal, it lacks specific guidance on *how* to handle situations where the retrieved information is insufficient or in an unexpected format, as demonstrated by the example. The LLM is essentially left to its own devices to interpret \"use the retrieved context.\" This leads to responses like the one observed, which accurately describes the data limitation but could be more helpful.\n\n**Specific Issues and How to Address Them:**\n\n1.  **Handling Insufficient/Inappropriate Data:** The prompt doesn't instruct the LLM on what to do if the `information` provided cannot directly answer the `query`. The feedback highlights this: the system stated it couldn't answer but didn't offer alternative insights or explain *what kind* of information *would* be needed.\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Add instructions to explicitly:\n        *   Acknowledge the query.\n        *   Assess if the provided information is suitable for answering the query.\n        *   If not suitable, clearly state the limitation and *explain why* based on the nature of the provided information.\n        *   Optionally, suggest what *kind* of information would be required or what *could* be inferred if the data were different (as suggested in the feedback).\n\n2.  **Clarifying the Nature of \"Information\":** The prompt refers to \"information retrieved from a graph\" generically. The example response correctly identifies it as \"a massive list of nodes and their connection status, with all connections remaining unexplored.\" However, the prompt doesn't prime the LLM to expect or interpret graph-based data specifically.\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Briefly characterize the *potential* nature of the retrieved information. This could include mentioning that it might be structured data, entity-relation triplets, node properties, etc., and that its narrative content might be implicit or absent.\n\n3.  **Encouraging More Helpful Responses:** The current prompt aims for a direct answer, not necessarily a helpful explanation of limitations. The feedback suggests the response could be more proactive and user-friendly.\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Modify the goal statement. Instead of just \"answer the query,\" it could be: \"Your goal is to use the retrieved context to answer the query *helpfully*. If the context is insufficient or unsuitable, explain the limitations clearly and constructively.\"\n\n**Revised Prompt Suggestion:**\n\nHere's a potential revised prompt incorporating these points:\n\n```\nYou are an AI assistant processing information retrieved from a knowledge graph. You will be given a user's query and the data extracted from the graph. Your task is to use this retrieved context to answer the query as helpfully and accurately as possible.\n\nConsider the following:\n1.  **Acknowledge the user's query.**\n2.  **Analyze the provided information.** This information might be in various forms, such as lists of nodes, relationships, properties, or extracted facts.\n3.  **Answer the query directly** if the information is sufficient and relevant.\n4.  **If the information is insufficient, irrelevant, or in a format that prevents answering the query (e.g., raw graph structure without narrative content):**\n    *   Clearly state that you cannot provide a direct answer to the query.\n    *   Explain *why* by referencing the limitations or nature of the provided information (e.g., \"The data consists of [description of data], which does not contain [type of information needed]\").\n    *   Optionally, suggest what kind of information or processing would be needed to answer the query.\n\nThis is the query:\n{}\n\nThis is the information retrieved from the graph:\n{}\n\nProvide your answer:\n```\n\nThis revised prompt explicitly guides the LLM on how to handle data limitations, making it more likely to generate helpful responses similar to the improved options suggested in the feedback.",
