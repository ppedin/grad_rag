  "retrieved_context": "Community 0 - Production and Publication of \"Raiders of the Second Moon\":\nThis community revolves around the creation and dissemination of the work \"Raiders of the Second Moon.\" Greg Weeks and Mary Meehan are identified as producers of this work, indicating their significant involvement in its development. The Online Distributed Proofreading Team played a crucial role by creating the etext, making the work accessible in a digital format. Furthermore, \"Raiders of the Second Moon\" was published in \"Planet Stories Summer 1945,\" highlighting its literary venue. Together, these entities illustrate the collaborative effort involved in bringing a literary work to its audience, from production to digital archiving and publication.\n\nCommunity 1 - Noork's Perilous Journey and Encounters:\nThis community centers around the character Noork, who is on a dangerous journey marked by conflict, evasion, and a quest for identity. Noork's past is linked to \"New York,\" and he was transported to \"Sekk's fertile valleys\" by a \"giant bird.\" He is currently traveling with \"the girl,\" with plans to take her to her \"brother's hidden village\" and subsequently to the \"city of Grath.\"\n\nNoork is a formidable survivor, having killed a \"first guard,\" \"guardian Misty One,\" and an \"other man\" during struggles, and he utilizes \"hooded cloaks\" for disguise. He has evaded or survived attacks, including one on the \"city of Bis\" by the \"warriors of the city of Konto,\" who inhabit a \"fertile valley\" and are enemies of those returning to the \"valley of Grath.\" Noork also warns about \"demons of the water.\"\n\nHis personal quest involves finding the \"giant bird\" to regain his memory and understanding of his past life in a \"jungle world.\" He has encountered a \"golden-skinned girl\" and \"young women\" who were captured. Noork is also concerned with his immediate surroundings, as evidenced by him slipping in \"cavern water,\" being in a \"chamber,\" entering a \"narrow stone-walled room\" where \"two warriors\" lay, and being hit by an \"unseen club.\" He seeks to reach the \"jungle\" and remove his current \"garment.\" The community's thematic representation lies in a protagonist's struggle for survival, self-discovery, and navigating a perilous world filled with both threats and potential allies.\n\nCommunity 2 - Von Mark's Quest for Invisibility and Earth Conquest:\nThis community centers around Doctor Von Mark, a villainous scientist who seeks the secret of invisibility to conquer Earth and make his Fatherland invincible. He operates from Sekk, a moon orbiting Luna, and is pursued by Captain Dietrich, an American who intends to live in the jungle. Doctor Von Mark mistakenly identifies others as Captain Dietrich. The key entities are Doctor Von Mark, Captain Dietrich, Earth, Fatherland, Sekk, Luna, and invisibility, highlighting a conflict between Von Mark's destructive ambitions and Captain Dietrich's pursuit, set against a backdrop of space and earthly locations. Thematic elements include scientific ambition, conquest, pursuit, and hidden identities.\n\nCommunity 3 - The Misty Ones: Island Dwellers and Mysterious Foes:\nThis community revolves around the enigmatic \"Misty Ones,\" a group associated with the \"island of Manak\" and the \"long lake of the Misty Ones.\" They are described as inhabitants of the \"mainland\" and the \"island of the unseen evil beings,\" and are also linked to the \"Temple of the Skull.\" The Misty Ones possess \"hooded faces\" and are perceived by the \"Priests of Uzdon.\" Their interactions are varied: they \"capture\" Rold, who is an \"Inhabitant Of\" Manak, and are themselves \"attacked\" by the \"Vasads.\" The Vasads also have a connection to an \"other bird\" that landed in the \"land of sunken valleys.\" The \"Temple of Uzdon\" is guarded by warriors associated with the Misty Ones. Thematically, this community portrays a supernatural or alien presence that inhabits distinct geographical locations, engages in conflict and predation, and is observed and understood by other entities.\n\nCommunity 4 - Exiles, Enslavement, and the Valley Cities:\nThis community centers around the intertwined fates of individuals and groups, often defined by conflict and subjugation. Key entities include Grath, an enemy city to Tholon Sarna; Gurn, an exile from Grath and brother to Tholon Sarna; and Sarna, who is also known as Tholon Sarna and is the daughter of Tholon Dist. Sarna is depicted as an escaping girl, and Tholon Sarna is imprisoned in the prison pit. The narrative also touches upon the Zuran people, whose enslavement is opposed, and Ud, a creature associated with the men of the jungles of Sekk. The golden men of the valley cities are noted for enslaving the men of the jungles of Sekk. The relationships highlight themes of exile (Gurn from Grath), familial ties (Tholon Sarna and Gurn as siblings, Sarna as daughter of Tholon Dist), conflict (Grath vs. Tholon Sarna), and oppression (enslavement of Zurans and men of the jungles of Sekk). The spotted narl's attack on the girl and its subsequent killing by someone (implied to be the girl or her protector) further adds to the sense of danger and struggle. Overall, this community represents a world grappling with societal structures of power, conflict between cities, and the harsh realities of enslavement and survival.\n\nCommunity 6 - Bird's Journey and Fiery Fate Above Valley:\nThis community centers around a **bird**, a **cliff**, a **fire**, and a **valley**. The narrative highlights the bird's action of carrying someone to the top of the cliff, which is situated above the valley. However, this aerial journey is dramatically interrupted as fire rises to devour the bird. Thematic elements include themes of transportation, elevation, and ultimately, destruction by natural forces.\n\nCommunity 10 - Doctor Von Mark's Cosmic Pursuit and Recovery:\nThis community centers around the enigmatic Doctor Karl Von Mark and his pursuit by Stephen Dietrich. Doctor Von Mark, driven by a mission to restore Nazidom, created crude space-ships. His activities took him from a hidden valley in Africa, where Stephen Dietrich also traveled in pursuit, to space and eventually to a \"little blob of cosmic matter\" situated beyond the Moon. Both Doctor Von Mark and Stephen Dietrich find themselves trapped on this cosmic matter. The narrative highlights a chase across continents and into space, involving rudimentary spacecraft and a peculiar cosmic location. Thematic elements include pursuit, lost memory (of Stephen Dietrich), ambitious restoration, and a perilous cosmic predicament.\n\nCommunity 12 - Island Temple, Skull, and Forbidden Levels:\nThis community centers around an island inhabited by slaves and common citizens. A significant structure, the Skull, is located in Konto, and appears to be part of a larger Temple complex. The Temple is guarded by invisible guards and the Misty Ones, and its lower levels, referred to as a prison, contain Tholon Sarna and caged young female slaves. The upper levels of this complex are strictly forbidden to both common citizens and slaves. The presence of beast men mingling with slaves suggests a grim and oppressive social dynamic on the island. Thematic elements revolve around control, hidden suffering, and forbidden knowledge or spaces within a religious or significant architectural setting.\n\nCommunity 15 - Priestly Secrets and Temple Guarded Access:\nThis community depicts a clandestine temple environment, centered around priests and their guarded secrets. The High Priest is aware of the temple guards' illicit desires for slave women, who are also tied to a ritualistic sacrifice. Access to certain areas is controlled by temple guards who restrict entry to all but priests, highlighting a hierarchy and controlled passage. Priests, affiliated with the \"Skull\" and wielding items like \"Uzdon's window\" and \"robes of invisibility,\" utilize stone steps to navigate between different levels, including a cavern and lower pits. They also employ swords and conical shields, indicating their role in conflict or defense. The presence of a brass door within a cavern, an inner wall, and a stairway entrance further illustrates the complex architecture and the guarded nature of this sacred space. Thematic elements include religious power, illicit desires, restricted access, and the hidden nature of sacred rituals.",

    "evaluation_feedback": "The ROUGE score of 0.1736 indicates that the generated response has a very low overlap with a human-written ideal summary. This suggests that the response, while lengthy, likely fails to capture the core plot points concisely and accurately.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the issues and how to improve the response:\n\n**Major Issues with the Current Response:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Cohesion and Narrative Flow:** The response jumps between multiple disparate plotlines without clearly establishing their connections or relative importance. It reads more like a collection of summaries of different subplots rather than a unified plot summary.\n2.  **Information Overload and Irrelevance:** The response includes a significant amount of detail that might be too specific or tangential to the main plot. For example, the detailed descriptions of the temple's architecture, the specific actions of guards, or the exact nature of the \"demons of the water\" might detract from the core narrative.\n3.  **Ambiguity and Unclear Relationships:** The relationships between characters and factions are often unclear. For instance, it's not immediately obvious how Von Mark's story connects to Noork's, or how the Misty Ones relate to the larger conflict.\n4.  **Repetitiveness:** Some information is repeated or presented in slightly different ways without adding new clarity.\n5.  **Grammatical Errors and Awkward Phrasing:** While not the primary issue, some sentences are awkwardly phrased (e.g., \"He carries 'the girl' to her brother's hidden village and intends to take her to the city of Grath.\").\n6.  **Inclusion of Extraneous Information:** The last paragraph, which mentions the literary work \"Raiders of the Second Moon\" and its authors/publication, is not part of the plot itself and should be excluded from a plot summary.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Conflict(s) and Protagonist(s):**\n    *   The primary antagonist seems to be Doctor Von Mark and his ambition to conquer Earth.\n    *   Captain Dietrich is presented as his pursuer. This is a clear conflict.\n    *   Noork's storyline appears to be a significant, possibly parallel, narrative with his own goals and struggles.\n    *   The Zuran people, Tholon Sarna, and the valley cities represent another set of conflicts.\n    *   **Improvement:** Start by identifying the *main* protagonist(s) and their primary goals. Then, introduce the antagonist(s) and their opposing goals. If multiple plotlines are equally important, clearly delineate them as separate but connected threads.\n\n2.  **Structure the Plot Logically:**\n    *   **Introduction:** Introduce the main characters and the central conflict. What is at stake?\n    *   **Rising Action:** Detail the key events that drive the plot forward for each main character/subplot. How do their paths intersect or diverge?\n    *   **Climax (if discernible from the text):** What is the peak of the conflict?\n    *   **Resolution (if discernible):** How do the conflicts conclude, or what is the state of affairs at the end of the provided text?\n    *   **Improvement:** Organize the information into a chronological or thematic structure. For example:\n        *   \"The story follows Dr. Von Mark, a villainous scientist on the moon Sekk, who seeks invisibility to conquer Earth...\"\n        *   \"Simultaneously, Noork embarks on a perilous journey...\"\n        *   \"Meanwhile, on the island of Manak, the mysterious Misty Ones...\"\n        *   \"These disparate threads converge as...\" (if they do)\n\n3.  **Prioritize Key Plot Points and Characters:**\n    *   Focus on *who* is doing *what* and *why*.\n    *   Exclude excessive descriptions of scenery, minor characters, or overly detailed mechanics of the world unless they are directly crucial to the plot's progression.\n    *   **Improvement:** Ask yourself: \"Does this detail move the story forward?\" If not, consider omitting it. For example, instead of detailing the temple's internal structure, state that \"The Misty Ones inhabit a temple where they guard secrets.\"\n\n4.  **Clarify Character Motivations and Relationships:**\n    *   Ensure it's clear why characters are acting the way they are.\n    *   Explicitly state relationships when important (e.g., \"Sarna, the daughter of Tholon Dist, is also known as Tholon Sarna\").\n    *   **Improvement:** Rephrase sentences to make motivations and connections explicit. For example: \"Von Mark's obsession with invisibility stems from his desire to make his Fatherland invincible.\"\n\n5.  **Condense and Synthesize Information:**\n    *   Combine similar ideas. If multiple characters are being pursued, group that information.\n    *   Use more concise language.\n    *   **Improvement:** Instead of listing every danger Noork faces, summarize his struggles: \"Noork faces numerous dangers, including attacks from warriors and treacherous environments, as he tries to regain his memory and protect 'the girl'.\"\n\n6.  **Remove Extraneous Information:**\n    *   The final sentence about \"Raiders of the Second Moon\" is bibliographic information, not plot. It should be removed.\n    *   **Improvement:** Edit the response to strictly focus on the narrative events of the story itself.\n\n**Example of a More Focused Summary (Based on the provided text):**\n\n\"The plot of the story involves multiple intertwined narratives. The primary antagonist is the villainous scientist Doctor Von Mark, who operates from Sekk, a moon orbiting Luna, and seeks the secret of invisibility to conquer Earth and achieve invincibility for his Fatherland. He is pursued by Captain Dietrich, an American. Their chase escalates from Africa to beyond the Moon, where they become trapped.\n\nConcurrently, a character named Noork is on a perilous journey. He seeks to regain his lost memory of a jungle world and carries a young girl to her brother's hidden village, intending to escort her further. Noork must contend with his past of conflict and survival, disguise himself, and evade various attackers while navigating treacherous environments.\n\nThe narrative also introduces the 'Misty Ones' inhabiting the island of Manak, who are linked to a 'Temple of the Skull' and are attacked by the Vasads. Furthermore, the story depicts the enslavement of the Zuran people and jungle dwellers by 'golden men' from valley cities. Tholon Sarna, a captive and daughter of Tholon Dist, is imprisoned and faces danger, including an attack from a spotted narl. The temple itself is a complex site with priests guarding secrets, controlling access, and utilizing slaves for rituals, while its lower levels serve as a prison. Beast men also roam the island.\n\nThese threads suggest a sprawling narrative of scientific ambition, cosmic pursuit, personal quests for identity and survival, and widespread conflict and enslavement across different locations.\"\n\nBy applying these suggestions, the response can become more focused, coherent, and accurately reflect the core plot of the story, leading to a significantly higher ROUGE score and a more useful summary.",

Your primary goal is to determine the most effective chunk size for graph construction, considering the provided critique and recommendations.\n\nWhen analyzing potential chunk sizes, prioritize the following principles:\n\n1.  **Contextual Completeness:** Select chunk sizes that are large enough to capture complete narrative units, sentence structures, and entity relationships within a single chunk. Avoid chunk sizes that fragment essential context, leading to incomplete entity motivations or actions. Consider how a chunk size impacts the ability to understand a cohesive piece of information.\n\n2.  **Relationship Robustness:** Aim for chunk sizes that facilitate the extraction of robust and well-defined relationships between entities. Insufficient context within a chunk can lead to fragmented information, hindering the graph's ability to represent accurate connections.\n\n3.  **Minimizing Boundary Artifacts:** Understand that splitting meaningful text across chunk boundaries can introduce redundancy and weaken graph connections. A larger chunk size generally helps mitigate issues like duplicate entity representations or relationships appearing in adjacent chunks, which can degrade graph quality.\n\n4.  **Granularity and Cohesion:** Evaluate how chunk size affects the granularity of the constructed graph. Ensure that chunks are large enough to group related information coherently, preventing minor plot elements from being isolated and improving community detection effectiveness.\n\n5.  **Narrative vs. Metadata Separation:** While the primary challenge is often within the graph extraction logic itself, a judicious chunk size can indirectly aid in contextualizing and potentially filtering metadata. However, focus primarily on maximizing the capture of narrative content and its relationships.\n\n**Your task is to reason about and recommend an optimal chunk size (e.g., 256, 512, 1024 tokens, or a range) for graph construction.** Justify your choice by explaining how it addresses the principles above, referencing potential issues with smaller chunk sizes (like fragmentation and boundary artifacts) and benefits of larger ones (like contextual completeness and robust relationships).

      "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 256 is likely contributing to the identified issues in the GraphRAG system. Here's a critique focused on how chunk size impacts the graph quality and subsequent retrieval:\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (256):**\n\n1.  **Insufficient Context for Granular Relationships:** A chunk size of 256 tokens might be too small to capture complete narrative arcs or relationships between entities that span across multiple sentences or paragraphs. This leads to fragmented information within a single chunk, preventing the graph extraction process from forming robust connections. For example, a character's motivation might be introduced early in a chunk, but its full consequence or elaboration might appear later, forcing the graph to represent an incomplete picture.\n\n2.  **Overlapping and Redundant Information Due to Boundary Issues:** When significant events or character interactions occur across chunk boundaries, the information is split. This can lead to:\n    *   **Redundant Entities/Relationships:** The same entity or relationship might be partially represented in two adjacent chunks, causing the graph merging to create duplicates or weak connections, contributing to the \"Severe Overlap and Redundancy\" critique. The Von Mark and Temple/Misty One examples are prime candidates for this issue.\n    *   **Loss of Cohesion:** A cohesive narrative segment could be broken into disparate chunks, making it difficult for community detection to group them effectively. This fragmentation contributes to \"Lack of Granularity\" and the issue of minor plot elements appearing in separate communities without clear context.\n\n3.  **Meta-Information Contamination (indirectly):** While not directly caused by chunk size, a small chunk size can inadvertently include meta-information. For instance, if the text includes a \"Transcriber's Note\" or production details within a 256-token block, it will be ingested. A larger chunk size *could* potentially isolate these notes better if they are self-contained, but more importantly, it allows for better contextual understanding of the *narrative* content around them, potentially aiding in filtering. However, the primary issue here is the inability to distinguish narrative from metadata, which is more of a graph extraction/filtering problem.\n\n**Recommendations for Chunk Size Improvement:**\n\n*   **Experiment with Larger Chunk Sizes:** Consider increasing the chunk size (e.g., 512, 1024 tokens) to allow for more complete sentences and paragraphs to be processed together. This should help in capturing more coherent entity relationships and narrative arcs within a single chunk, reducing fragmentation and redundancy.\n*   **Adaptive Chunking (Advanced):** If possible, explore adaptive chunking strategies that can dynamically adjust chunk size based on sentence or paragraph boundaries, or even semantic coherence, rather than a fixed token count. This would minimize splitting meaningful narrative units.\n*   **Focus on \"Semantically Complete\" Units:** The goal should be to create chunks that represent a relatively self-contained piece of information or narrative event. A fixed size might not achieve this optimally across different writing styles.\n\nBy adjusting the chunk size, the system can better capture the nuances of the text, leading to a more cohesive and informative knowledge graph, which in turn will improve the accuracy and relevance of the community summarization and retrieval process.",
      "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The current prompt for graph construction has several limitations that hinder the generation of a coherent plot summary, as evidenced by the critique of the resulting graph and retrieval plan.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique and how it relates to the prompt:\n\n**1. Lack of Narrative Cohesion & Hierarchy:**\n\n*   **Prompt Issue:** The prompt focuses on identifying *all* entities and relationships without explicit guidance on prioritizing or weighting them based on narrative importance. The constraints of \"no more than 20 entities and 30 relationships\" are arbitrary and don't account for the complexity of a plot. This leads to a flat graph where tangential or minor plotlines can become as prominent as the main narrative.\n*   **Critique Reflection:** The critique highlights disparate communities and the absence of a narrative hierarchy. This is a direct consequence of the prompt not instructing the LLM to identify a central protagonist or primary conflict to guide entity and relationship extraction.\n\n**2. Ambiguity and Contradiction Handling:**\n\n*   **Prompt Issue:** The prompt asks for entities, types, properties, relationships, descriptions, and evidence. It doesn't provide a mechanism for handling conflicting information about the *same* entity across different parts of the text or different chunks. The LLM is not instructed to reconcile or flag discrepancies.\n*   **Critique Reflection:** The critique points out specific contradictions (Von Mark's motivations, Tholon Sarna's status). The prompt's structure implicitly encourages a single, unified representation for each entity, making it difficult to capture nuances or evolving states.\n\n**3. Insufficient Focus on Causality and Motivation:**\n\n*   **Prompt Issue:** While the prompt asks for relationship descriptions and evidence, it doesn't explicitly ask the LLM to infer *why* entities are related or to focus on causal links and character motivations. The emphasis is on descriptive attributes and explicit relationships.\n*   **Critique Reflection:** The critique states that summaries are descriptive lists and lack causal illumination. This suggests the prompt should push for a deeper analysis of \"why\" events happen and \"why\" characters act, rather than just \"what\" happened.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Significance:** Instruct the LLM to identify the main protagonist(s) and primary conflict(s) first. Then, guide entity and relationship extraction to prioritize elements that directly contribute to these central narrative threads. Consider a weighting system or different prompt sections for main vs. secondary plot elements.\n2.  **Introduce Discrepancy Handling:** Explicitly instruct the LLM to identify and flag conflicting information about entities. This could involve creating separate nodes for different versions/states of an entity, linked with a \"contradicts\" or \"evolves_to\" relationship, or adding a specific \"conflict_status\" property.\n3.  **Emphasize Causal and Motivational Links:** Modify the relationship extraction instructions to specifically ask for the underlying motivations, causes, and effects. For example, include a \"motivation\" field for relationships between characters and an \"effect\" field for event-related relationships.\n4.  **Refine Granularity and Specificity:** Encourage the LLM to be more specific in entity types and relationship descriptions, especially when dealing with similar entities or recurring events. Add instructions to differentiate temporal aspects of entities and relationships.",
      "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the community selection, focusing on improving the prompt and system for retrieving plot information:\n\n**Critique of Community Selection for Plot Retrieval:**\n\nThe current community selection is overly broad and exhibits significant overlap, hindering precise plot summarization. The inclusion of extraneous information and a lack of clear prioritization of narrative threads are critical issues.\n\n1.  **Redundancy and Overlapping Focus:**\n    *   **Doctor Von Mark:** Communities 2 and 10 both heavily feature Doctor Von Mark, his pursuit, and motivations. The summaries present slightly different but related details without resolving ambiguities (e.g., Captain vs. Stephen Dietrich). This indicates potential over-clustering or a failure to distinguish distinct phases of his arc.\n    *   **Temples and Misty Ones:** Communities 3, 12, and 15 all describe temples, guards, priests, and the Misty Ones, often in related locations. The summaries are highly similar, making it difficult to ascertain unique contributions to a plot summary. This suggests a single conceptual cluster has been fragmented.\n\n2.  **Inclusion of Meta-Information:** Community 0, detailing the \"Production and Publication\" of \"Raiders of the Second Moon,\" is meta-information about the story's origin. Its inclusion is fundamentally incorrect for plot retrieval, as it's external context, not narrative content. The system must filter such meta-information.\n\n3.  **Lack of Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   The selection includes very broad summaries (e.g., Community 1 on Noork's journey) and potentially minor elements (Community 6 on a bird's fate). For a plot summary, the agent needs to discern and prioritize core narrative drivers (protagonist actions, antagonist plans, central conflicts) over descriptive or tangential elements. The current selection suggests an indiscriminate approach.\n\n4.  **Ambiguous Scope and Contribution:** It's unclear how communities like 3, 12, and 15, despite their focus on temples, contribute distinct narrative elements to a cohesive plot summary when they overlap so heavily. The agent struggles to identify truly unique plot contributions.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n*   **Explicitly Instruct Agent to Ignore Meta-Information:** The prompt should include a directive like: \"Do not select communities that describe the publication, production, or external meta-information about the story. Focus solely on communities that detail events, characters, and conflicts *within* the narrative.\"\n*   **Emphasize Plot Progression:** Reinforce the need to select communities that represent *key plot drivers*. Add: \"Prioritize communities that outline major character arcs, antagonist schemes, central conflicts, and significant turning points. Avoid selecting communities that appear to be tangential, world-building details, or redundancies unless they directly advance the primary plot.\"\n*   **Guide on Handling Overlap:** Instruct the agent on how to handle overlapping entities: \"If multiple communities cover similar characters or events, select the one that provides the most distinct and essential plot information. If overlap is unavoidable, explain how the combined communities offer a more comprehensive plot overview by covering different facets of the same narrative element.\"\n*   **Request Justification for Overlap:** The prompt already asks for reasoning. Refine this to specifically ask *why* overlapping communities were chosen together, ensuring they offer complementary plot details rather than simply repeating information.",
      "answer_generation_critique": "The provided prompt is effective at outlining the desired qualities of a plot summary (narrative cohesion, clarity, prioritization, etc.) but lacks specificity in guiding the LLM to **synthesize disparate plot threads into a single, coherent narrative**. The generated answer's failure to do so, as highlighted by the feedback, points to this deficiency.\n\nHere's a critique of the prompt and suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Critique of Current Prompt:**\n\n1.  **\"Synthesize retrieved graph information into a coherent, engaging, and definitive plot summary that directly answers the user's query.\"**\n    *   **Issue:** \"Synthesize\" is too general. The prompt doesn't instruct *how* to synthesize multiple, potentially disconnected, pieces of information from graph communities into a unified story. The generated answer shows this failure by presenting plot points as a list rather than a narrative flow.\n    *   **Issue:** \"Coherent\" is requested, but the prompt doesn't provide mechanisms for achieving it when faced with fragmented data.\n\n2.  **\"Structure the summary into a single, flowing narrative arc. Chronologically or thematically organize events, characters, and plotlines with explicit, smooth transitions.\"**\n    *   **Issue:** This directive is strong but assumes the retrieved information naturally forms a single arc. It doesn't account for the reality of Graph RAG where communities might represent distinct subplots or character arcs that don't immediately connect. The prompt needs to guide the LLM on *how to infer or construct* connections when they aren't explicit.\n\n3.  **\"Prioritize and Conciseness: Focus on the core narrative: identify and highlight the protagonist's main goal, primary antagonist(s), central conflict, and key turning points. Distinguish essential plot drivers from minor details...\"**\n    *   **Issue:** While good, it doesn't explicitly tell the LLM to *deduce* these core elements if they aren't immediately obvious from individual community summaries. The feedback mentions the LLM failing to identify the *main* protagonist and central conflict, suggesting it treated all retrieved information as equally important.\n\n4.  **Lack of Instruction on Handling Disconnected Information:**\n    *   **Issue:** The prompt doesn't address what to do when community summaries don't directly link. The current answer's failure to weave threads together and instead list them suggests a need for explicit instruction on synthesizing *potentially fragmented* information.\n\n**Suggestions for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Emphasize Synthesis of Fragmented Information:**\n    *   Add a directive like: \"When presented with multiple, potentially disconnected plot threads from different communities, your primary task is to **identify the most prominent narrative threads and attempt to weave them into a cohesive story**. If direct connections are not explicit, infer plausible relationships or present them as parallel plotlines contributing to an overarching theme. **Avoid simply listing summaries of individual communities.**\"\n\n2.  **Guidance on Identifying Core vs. Supporting Narratives:**\n    *   Refine the prioritization directive: \"Identify the **central protagonist(s) and their primary objectives**. Then, identify the **main antagonist(s) and the central conflict(s)**. **Prioritize information directly related to these core elements.** Subordinate or omit details from less central plotlines or communities unless they directly impact the main narrative or provide crucial context.\"\n\n3.  **Instruction on Constructing Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Add: \"Use transitional phrases to connect distinct plot points or character arcs, signaling if they are happening concurrently, sequentially, or represent a different facet of the overall conflict. For example, use phrases like 'Meanwhile,' 'In parallel,' 'Elsewhere,' or 'Adding to the conflict...'\"\n\n4.  **Explicitly Discourage Listing:**\n    *   Add: \"Do not present the summary as a series of bullet points or separate paragraphs for each retrieved community. The output must be a single, narrative text.\"\n\nBy incorporating these, the prompt will provide more actionable guidance on how to construct a cohesive plot summary from potentially fragmented graph data, directly addressing the failures observed in the example.",
