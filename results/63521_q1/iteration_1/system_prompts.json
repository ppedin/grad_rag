  "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 200 appears to be a contributing factor to the identified weaknesses in the graph, particularly concerning narrative structure and relationship richness.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the chunk size might be impacting the graph quality:\n\n1.  **Insufficient Context within Chunks for Narrative Flow:** A chunk size of 200 tokens might be too small to capture a complete narrative arc or even a significant segment of one. This can lead to:\n    *   **Fragmented Events:** Events that span across chunk boundaries will be split, making it difficult to extract complete actions, their consequences, or the motivations behind them. For example, a character's decision in one chunk might be acted upon in a subsequent chunk, but the causal link might be weak or lost due to the split.\n    *   **Loss of Temporal and Causal Connections:** Without sufficient context within a chunk, the LLM extracting graphs might struggle to infer the order of events or understand direct cause-and-effect relationships. This directly relates to the critique about the lack of temporal order and causal links.\n\n2.  **Generic Relationships due to Limited Context:** When a chunk is too small, the LLM has less information to identify specific, nuanced relationships. It might default to more general connections like \"associated with\" or \"interacted with\" simply because it cannot glean enough semantic detail from the limited text within a single chunk to infer more specific narrative functions (e.g., \"causes\\_conflict\\_with,\" \"motivates\\_action\"). This contributes to the \"Shallow Relationship Definitions\" critique.\n\n3.  **Difficulty in Forming \"Event\" Nodes:** Creating meaningful \"Event\" nodes requires understanding a sequence of actions, involved entities, and their outcomes. With small chunks, the information to define a robust event might be scattered. The LLM might extract partial events or fail to recognize the significance of an event if its full context isn't contained within a single chunk. This directly impacts the \"Lack of Event/Scene Nodes\" critique.\n\n4.  **Inconsistent Granularity and Over-segmentation:** A fixed chunk size can lead to over-segmentation if narrative segments naturally vary in length. A 200-token chunk might arbitrarily cut off important descriptive passages or dialogue that are crucial for understanding character motivations or plot development. Conversely, a very short narrative segment might be artificially stretched across multiple chunks if it's padded to meet the minimum chunk size. This exacerbates the \"Inconsistent Granularity of Information\" critique, as it leads to an abundance of very specific, low-cardinality relationships derived from incomplete contexts.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nConsider experimenting with a *larger chunk size*. This would allow for more coherent narrative segments to be processed together, potentially leading to richer relationship extraction, better event representation, and a stronger overall narrative structure in the generated graph. Alternatively, exploring *adaptive chunking strategies* that consider semantic boundaries (e.g., paragraph breaks, scene changes) might be more effective than a fixed token count for capturing narrative flow.",
  "graph_builder_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the provided graph construction prompt, focusing on areas for improvement to enhance graph quality for plot-centric queries:\n\n**Critique of the Graph Construction Prompt:**\n\nThe current prompt, while aiming to extract entities and relationships, suffers from several shortcomings that lead to the problematic graph structure observed. The primary issues are:\n\n1.  **Overly Broad Relationship Definitions:** The prompt asks for \"all the relationships among the identified entities\" without providing specific examples or constraints on their semantic richness. This leads to the generation of numerous generic relationships like \"associated with,\" \"is a,\" and even the uninformative \"relationship.\" The lack of specificity means these connections offer little actionable insight for understanding plot progression.\n\n2.  **Lack of Guidance on Entity Types:** While some example entity types are given (Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept), the prompt doesn't strongly emphasize the *importance* of specific types like \"Event\" or \"Action.\" The resulting graph being dominated by \"Location\" and \"Person\" nodes suggests that narrative-driving events are not being adequately identified and categorized as distinct entities.\n\n3.  **Insufficient Emphasis on Plot-Relevant Semantics:** The prompt focuses on identifying *any* relationship, rather than prioritizing relationships crucial for narrative understanding. There's no instruction to identify relationships that indicate causality, sequence, motivation, conflict, or resolution â€“ key components of a plot. This results in a graph that describes static states more than dynamic storytelling.\n\n4.  **Potential for Redundancy and Ambiguity:** Without explicit instructions to disambiguate or consolidate, the LLM is free to generate similar but slightly varied relationship types (e.g., \"attacks\" vs. \"attacked by\"). This leads to an explosion of low-frequency, overlapping relationship types, making analysis difficult. The prompt doesn't guide the LLM towards a consistent and hierarchical ontology of relationships.\n\n5.  **Insufficient Prompting for \"Why\":** While the prompt asks for a \"description (why you think the two entities are related to each other),\" this is often a weak point in LLM outputs and can be easily satisfied with superficial reasoning. The prompt could be enhanced by explicitly asking for *causal*, *temporal*, or *purposeful* explanations for relationships.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n*   **Mandate Specific, Semantic Relationship Types:** Provide a curated list of desired relationship types that capture plot elements (e.g., `causes`, `precedes`, `motivates`, `conflict_with`, `resolves`, `discovers`, `travels_to`). Instruct the LLM to *only* use these or similar specific types, penalizing generic ones.\n*   **Prioritize \"Event\" and \"Action\" Entities:** Explicitly instruct the LLM to identify and extract key narrative events or actions as distinct entities of type \"Event\" or \"Action.\" Define relationships that link these events to involved characters and locations.\n*   **Focus on Narrative Causality and Sequence:** Modify the prompt to specifically ask for relationships that define cause-and-effect or temporal order between entities and events.\n*   **Enforce Relationship Consolidation:** Instruct the LLM to use consistent naming conventions and to avoid generating redundant or overly similar relationship types. For example, specify how to handle active vs. passive voice or different nuances of interaction.\n*   **Strengthen the \"Description/Evidence\" Requirement:** Require the description of relationships to explicitly state the *plot function* or *narrative significance* of the connection, rather than just a textual justification.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the prompt can guide the LLM to generate a graph that is more structured, semantically rich, and directly conducive to answering plot-centric queries.",
  "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the provided retrieval plans and their outcomes, focusing on improving the retrieval planning prompt:\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Strategic Depth for Plot Construction:** The retrieval plans consistently focus on retrieving individual facts or immediate neighbors of an entity (\"Karl Von Mark\"). While this is a good start for gathering data points, it doesn't outline a strategy to *synthesize* these points into a coherent plot. A plot requires understanding the sequence of events, cause-and-effect relationships, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions, which are not explicitly targeted by the current retrieval actions.\n\n2.  **Incomplete Exploration of Key Entities/Relationships:** Despite the goal of understanding the \"plot,\" crucial entities and relationship types that would define a narrative arc appear underdeveloped in the retrieved context. For instance, the motivations (\"wants to conquer,\" \"wants to make invincible\") are retrieved, but their connection to specific events or consequences is not explored. The \"priest of the Skull\" and \"Fatherland\" are mentioned but not sufficiently contextualized.\n\n3.  **Inefficient and Redundant Retrieval:** The repetition of identical retrieval results across iterations (\"Iteration 2 results\" and \"Iteration 3 results\") strongly suggests an issue with the retrieval or graph merging process. This redundancy wastes computational resources and indicates that the system isn't effectively progressing or discovering new information relevant to the plot.\n\n4.  **Weak Link Between Retrieval and \"Plot\":** The current retrieval actions primarily gather isolated facts about entities and their direct connections. The plans lack a mechanism to identify and retrieve information that forms a narrative structure, such as identifying the protagonist's primary goal, antagonists, obstacles, or the progression of the story.\n\n**Feedback for Retrieval Planning Prompt Improvement:**\n\nTo address these issues, the retrieval planning prompt should guide the agent to:\n\n*   **Prioritize Narrative Elements:** Explicitly instruct the agent to look for information that builds a narrative. This includes identifying:\n    *   **Central Conflicts:** What are the main opposing forces or desires?\n    *   **Character Goals and Motivations:** Beyond simple attributes, what drives the characters' actions?\n    *   **Sequence of Events:** How do actions lead to consequences? (e.g., exploring relationships that indicate causality or progression).\n    *   **Key Plot Points:** Turning points, climax, resolution.\n*   **Develop Multi-Hop Strategies:** Encourage exploration beyond immediate neighbors. The prompt should suggest a need to traverse relationships multiple steps to connect disparate pieces of information that, when combined, reveal the plot. For example, \"After identifying a character's desire, search for actions or events that fulfill or obstruct that desire.\"\n*   **Focus on Relationship Types:** Guide the agent to prioritize relationship types that are indicative of plot progression (e.g., \"travels to,\" \"attacks,\" \"killed,\" \"rescues,\" \"conquers,\" \"fears\").\n*   **Avoid Redundancy and Ensure Progress:** Implicitly or explicitly guide the agent to ensure each step adds new, non-redundant information relevant to the query. If a node or relationship has already been fully explored, the agent should move on.\n*   **Contextualize Information:** The prompt should encourage retrieving information that contextualizes facts. For example, not just \"X attacks Y,\" but *why* or *what is the result* of X attacking Y.",
  "answer_generation_critique": "Critique of the Previous Answer Generation Prompt:\n\nThe current prompt is too generic and lacks specific instructions for the LLM to generate a comprehensive plot summary, as highlighted by the feedback. The core issue is that the prompt asks the LLM to \"answer the query\" using \"retrieved context\" without guiding it on *how* to structure or what information to prioritize for a plot summary.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the issues and suggestions for prompt improvement:\n\n1.  **Lack of Specificity for \"Plot\":**\n    *   **Issue:** The prompt assumes the LLM understands what constitutes a \"plot summary\" and how to extract it from graph data. The feedback clearly indicates the generated answer was a \"snippet\" and lacked \"crucial elements.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** The prompt should explicitly define what a plot summary entails in this context. It needs to instruct the LLM to identify and articulate the narrative arc.\n\n2.  **Insufficient Guidance on Context Extraction:**\n    *   **Issue:** The prompt only mentions using \"retrieved context.\" It doesn't tell the LLM to synthesize information, define terms, or connect disparate pieces of information that are essential for understanding a plot.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Instruct the LLM to synthesize the provided information to construct a coherent narrative. Emphasize the need to explain key terms (like \"Priest of the Skull\" or \"Fatherland\") if they are present in the context.\n\n3.  **Absence of Structural Directives:**\n    *   **Issue:** The feedback points out the response was a \"single, somewhat run-on sentence\" and lacked structure. The prompt doesn't guide the LLM on organizing the answer logically.\n    *   **Suggestion:** The prompt should direct the LLM to structure the answer, potentially suggesting elements like character introduction, conflict, and resolution.\n\n4.  **Failure to Address Ambiguity:**\n    *   **Issue:** The feedback mentions ambiguity in phrases like \"using a secret of invisibility.\" The generic prompt doesn't prompt the LLM to resolve or clarify such ambiguities based on the graph context.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Instruct the LLM to clarify any ambiguous terms or actions based on the information available in the retrieved context.\n\n**Revised Prompt Suggestion:**\n\n\"You will be given a query and information extracted from a graph. Your task is to use this information to provide a comprehensive and coherent answer to the query.\n\nSpecifically, if the query asks for a plot summary, you must construct a narrative that includes:\n1.  **Introduction:** Key characters, setting, and the initial situation.\n2.  **Conflict:** The main problem or goal driving the story, including the antagonist's motivations and actions.\n3.  **Progression:** Significant events, challenges, or developments that occur.\n4.  **Resolution:** The outcome of the main conflict and the story's conclusion.\n\nSynthesize all provided information to build this narrative. If the context contains unexplained terms or concepts relevant to the plot (e.g., specific organizations, titles, or technologies), define them clearly within your answer.
