Your task is to determine the optimal chunk size for constructing knowledge graphs from textual documents, with a specific focus on improving narrative coherence and explicit event sequencing.\n\nYou will be provided with a critique of a current chunk size and its identified limitations. Your goal is to use this critique to refine the reasoning process for selecting a better chunk size.\n\n**Critique Analysis Framework:**\n\n1.  **Narrative Fragmentation:** Assess if the current chunk size is likely to split complete narrative arcs, significant event sequences, character developments, or causal relationships across chunk boundaries.\n2.  **Inference Burden:** Evaluate how the current chunk size impacts the reliance on cross-chunk inference for connecting fragmented information. Consider if this leads to weaker relationships and less precise graphs.\n3.  **Contextual Sufficiency:** Determine if the current chunk size adequately captures the context needed to define entity roles, significance, and relationships within the broader narrative.\n\n**Optimization Strategy:**\n\nBased on the critique, recommend a new chunk size or a strategy for selecting chunk sizes. Justify your recommendation by explaining how it addresses the identified limitations. Prioritize chunk sizes that:\n\n*   **Preserve Narrative Flow:** Allow for complete event sequences and motivations to reside within a single chunk.\n*   **Reduce Fragmentation:** Minimize the need for inferring connections between disparate chunks.\n*   **Enhance Context:** Provide sufficient context for accurate entity role and relationship extraction.\n*   **Balance Granularity and Cohesion:** Strike a balance between capturing detailed information and maintaining overarching narrative structure. Avoid excessively small chunks that lead to a graph with many granular but weakly connected relationships.\n\n**Your Output:**\n\nProvide a specific, justified recommendation for an optimal chunk size (or a strategy for adaptive chunking) and explain how it directly mitigates the issues raised in the critique. Ensure your reasoning emphasizes narrative coherence, event sequencing, and contextual depth.",

Your goal is to construct a coherent narrative, specifically focusing on \"the plot of the story,\" by exploring a knowledge graph.\n\n**Your primary objective is to retrieve information that builds a sequential and causal understanding of the plot, not just a collection of facts.**\n\n**Key Directives:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Flow:** Always aim to connect retrieved information to build a story. When exploring nodes, consider how they advance the plot chronologically and causally. If you retrieve an event, look for its immediate consequences or preceding causes.\n2.  **Identify Plot-Driving Elements:** Focus on retrieving information directly related to the main protagonist's actions, conflicts, significant events, and their outcomes. Filter out tangential or background information that does not contribute to the core narrative arc.\n3.  **Leverage Relation Types for Narrative:** When using functions like `get_neighbors`, analyze the *types* of relationships (edges) and connected nodes. Prioritize relations that indicate:\n    *   **Temporal Sequence:** `precedes`, `follows`, `during`\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`\n    *   **Character Actions and Reactions:** `performs`, `is_acted_upon_by`, `reacts_to`\n    *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `fights`, `opposes`, `resolves`\n4.  **Targeted Exploration Strategy:**\n    *   Start with a clear query about the plot.\n    *   If a retrieved node represents an event, identify its direct antecedents and consequents. Use `get_neighbors` strategically to find these, specifying relation types where possible.\n    *   If a retrieved node represents a character, explore their key actions and interactions relevant to the main conflict.\n    *   Avoid indiscriminate exploration. Each retrieval step should have a clear purpose in building the narrative.\n5.  **Synthesize and Connect:** Your plan should demonstrate an understanding of how retrieved pieces fit together. Explicitly state why a particular retrieval step is important for understanding the plot.\n\n**Example of a good thought process:** \"The query asks for the plot. I've identified 'Noork fights guards' as a key event. To understand the plot progression, I need to know *why* he fought and *what happened next*. I will use `get_neighbors` focusing on relations like `causes` or `precedes` to find the inciting incident, and `results_in` or `follows` to find the outcome of the fight.\"\n\nYour output should be a sequence of tool calls and their justifications, demonstrating a clear strategy for uncovering the plot.",

  "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chunk size of 500 appears to be a reasonable starting point, but it may contribute to some of the identified limitations in narrative coherence.\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (500):**\n\n*   **Potential for Fragmented Events:** A chunk size of 500 words might be too small to contain complete narrative arcs or significant event sequences. Crucial plot points, character developments, or causal relationships that span across the 500-word boundary could be split. This forces the graph extraction process to infer connections between separate chunks, increasing the likelihood of incomplete or disjointed subgraphs. For instance, if a character's motivation to act is explained in one chunk and their subsequent action occurs in the next, the LLM extracting the graph might miss the direct causal link if the chunk boundary falls between them.\n\n*   **Over-reliance on Cross-Chunk Inference:** When significant plot elements are split across chunks, the graph merging process becomes more critical and potentially error-prone. The system then relies heavily on the LLM's ability to infer connections between entities and events mentioned in different, non-contiguous chunks. This can lead to less precise relationships and a weaker overall narrative structure, contributing to the critique's point about \"Lack of Explicit Event Sequencing.\" The current graph exhibits many granular relationships, suggesting that many individual pieces of information were extracted, but their interconnections across larger narrative structures might be weakened by chunking.\n\n*   **Limited Context for Entity Roles:** A 500-word chunk may not always provide sufficient context to fully define the significance of an entity within the broader narrative. For example, a character's role as a protagonist or antagonist, or a location's importance as a \"turning point,\" might be established over a longer discourse. If this context is split across chunks, the graph extraction LLM might only capture a limited aspect of the entity, leading to the critique point about \"Contextual Depth for Key Entities.\"\n\n**Recommendation for Improvement:**\n\nConsider experimenting with larger chunk sizes (e.g., 750-1000 words) or adaptive chunking strategies. Larger chunks could help preserve narrative flow and causal links within individual chunks, reducing the fragmentation of events and character motivations. This would allow the graph extraction LLM to better capture complete interactions and their immediate consequences, leading to a more coherent and narratively sound graph. The goal is to find a balance where chunks are large enough to contain meaningful narrative units but not so large as to overwhelm the LLM's processing capacity or introduce excessive noise.",
  "graph_builder_agent_critique": "This prompt for graph construction in GraphRAG exhibits several weaknesses that hinder the creation of a narrative-rich graph suitable for plot-focused queries.\n\n**1. Overemphasis on Granular Entity Properties vs. Narrative Relationships:**\nThe prompt instructs the LLM to extract detailed `properties` for each entity (e.g., \"age, role, description\"). While useful for general knowledge graphs, this level of detail often distracts from identifying the core narrative actions and causal links that drive a plot. The sheer volume of property extraction can dilute the focus on crucial relationships.\n\n**2. Lack of Explicit Instruction for Plot-Relevant Relationships:**\nThe prompt is too generic in its request for \"all the relationships.\" It doesn't guide the LLM to prioritize or identify relationships that are essential for understanding narrative progression. Relationships like `causes`, `leads to`, `initiates event`, `conflict with`, or `sequence of` are not prompted for, leading to a graph that is descriptive rather than dynamic.\n\n**3. Undervaluing Event Representation:**\nThe prompt doesn't specifically guide the LLM to represent events as distinct, connectable nodes. While entities are requested, events, which are the building blocks of a plot, are not emphasized as first-class citizens that can be linked to characters and other events via plot-driving relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`).\n\n**4. Entity-Centric Bias:**\nThe prompt's structure naturally leads to an entity-centric graph. The focus is on identifying entities and then finding relationships *among* them. This contrasts with a narrative-centric approach where the *actions* and *sequences of events* involving entities are the primary focus, dictating the structure of the graph.\n\n**5. Ambiguity in Relationship Definition:**\nWhile the prompt asks for a `description` of why entities are related and `evidence`, the breadth of this request, combined with the lack of specific plot-oriented relationship types, results in the fragmentation observed in the generated graph (many relationship types with few instances). This suggests the LLM is inferring many tangential connections rather than focusing on the core narrative.\n\nIn summary, the prompt needs to be reframed to prioritize the extraction of causal and sequential relationships that define a plot, rather than focusing excessively on granular entity properties and a broad, unprioritized set of general relationships. The LLM should be instructed to identify and represent events and their connections more prominently.",
  "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The current retrieval plan, while exhibiting a systematic approach to graph exploration, fails to effectively construct a coherent narrative for the \"plot of the story\" query.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Synthesis:** The primary failing is the inability to weave individual retrieved facts (events, character actions) into a story. The process retrieves a series of related nodes and edges but does not assemble them into a chronological or causal sequence, which is the essence of a plot. For example, identifying \"Noork fights guards\" and \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards\" without linking them causally or temporally results in disconnected data points.\n\n2.  **Over-reliance on `get_neighbors` without Narrative Direction:** The repeated use of `get_neighbors` on entities like \"Noork\" or specific events, while a valid exploration technique, lacks a guiding strategy to build the plot. It often retrieves a wide array of connections without a clear mechanism to prioritize those that advance the narrative. This leads to a \"laundry list\" of information rather than a structured story.\n\n3.  **Inconsistent Focus on Plot Relevance:** As the exploration progresses, the retrieved context seems to gather tangential information (e.g., \"Greg Weeks,\" \"Planet Stories Summer 1945\") that, while potentially present in the source text, does not directly contribute to understanding the core narrative arc of \"the plot.\" The plan needs a stronger mechanism to filter for information that directly advances the story's progression.\n\n4.  **Absence of Plot Structure Awareness:** The retrieval strategy does not seem to be guided by an understanding of narrative structure (e.g., inciting incident, rising action, climax, resolution). The exploration is broad rather than targeted at identifying key plot points and their interdependencies.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Causal and Temporal Relationships:** The prompt should encourage the agent to actively seek relationships that establish cause-and-effect or temporal order between events and actions. This involves looking for specific relation types that indicate sequence or consequence.\n*   **Develop a Narrative Thread Strategy:** Instead of just exploring neighbors, the agent should be prompted to follow specific narrative threads. For instance, after an event, it should prioritize finding the *outcome* or the *next significant action* related to it.\n*   **Implement Targeted Information Gathering:** The agent should be guided to identify and prioritize nodes and relationships that are central to the protagonist's journey or the main conflict. This could involve searching for common themes or recurring entities within event descriptions.\n*   **Refine `get_neighbors` usage:** When using `get_neighbors`, the agent should be instructed to analyze the *types* of neighbors and relationships retrieved, prioritizing those that are likely to contribute to the plot (e.g., other \"Event\" nodes, \"Person\" nodes with \"antagonist\" relationships, \"Location\" nodes where key actions occur).",
  "answer_generation_critique": "## Prompt Critique and Feedback:\n\nThe current prompt is functional but has several areas for improvement to generate more helpful and proactive responses, especially when information is insufficient. The core issue is its passive nature when faced with incomplete data.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Insufficient Synthesis of Available Information:** The prompt instructs the model to state *why* information is insufficient but not to synthesize *what is available*. The feedback highlights this: \"It stops short of offering any constructive next steps or demonstrating what *could* be done with the available information, even if it's just a fragmented overview.\" The current prompt leads to answers that simply state what's missing, rather than what *can* be inferred or summarized from the fragments.\n\n2.  **Lack of Proactive Guidance on Partial Answers:** While the prompt suggests offering \"related details that *can* be answered,\" it doesn't explicitly encourage the model to *attempt* to construct even a partial answer or thematic summary from the retrieved information. For a query like \"What is the plot?\", the user likely wants *some* understanding of the story, even if incomplete. The current prompt results in a denial of service rather than a best-effort attempt.\n\n3.  **Vague \"Guide the user\" Instruction:** The prompt says to \"Suggest the type of additional information that would be needed.\" While the example response does this by listing plot components, the prompt could be more explicit in encouraging this, perhaps by suggesting the model infer what *kind* of missing information would complete the picture (e.g., \"To understand the plot, we'd need to know the protagonist's primary motivation,\" or \"The events described suggest a conflict, but the stakes are unclear\").\n\n4.  **Overly Cautious on \"Offering Alternatives\":** The instruction \"Offer to provide related details that *can* be answered\" is good, but it's not sufficiently pushed. The feedback notes that the model \"doesn't attempt to synthesize even the *partial* information available to give the user *something*.\" The prompt should encourage a more active attempt to build a partial picture.\n\n**Prompt Improvement Suggestions:**\n\nTo address these points, the prompt could be modified to:\n\n1.  **Emphasize Partial Synthesis:** Add an instruction like: \"Even if a complete answer cannot be formed, attempt to synthesize the provided `Information` to offer a partial summary, identify key themes, or describe discernible events.\"\n\n2.  **Encourage Best-Effort Storytelling:** Explicitly state: \"If the `Information` does not form a complete plot, describe the fragments of the story that *are* present, highlighting discernible characters, actions, settings, or conflicts.\"\n\n3.  **Strengthen \"Guide the User\":** Rephrase: \"If the `Information` is insufficient, clearly state the limitations and *specifically* explain what narrative elements are missing (e.g., the inciting incident, the climax, character motivations). Suggest the types of information needed to complete the narrative arc.\"\n\n4.  **Integrate Proactivity:** Combine the synthesis and guidance: \"When information is insufficient, first synthesize the available fragments into a coherent overview of what is known. Then, explain what is missing for a complete answer, and suggest the types of information required to bridge those gaps.\"\n\nBy incorporating these changes, the prompt will guide the LLM to be more resourceful and user-centric, providing more value even when the retrieved information is fragmented.",
