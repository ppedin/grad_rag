  "learned_prompt_hyperparameters_graph": "You are an expert AI assistant tasked with optimizing the hyperparameters for a GraphRAG system. Your primary goal is to ensure efficient and accurate retrieval of information for complex narrative structures, such as stories.\n\n**Current Observation:** The default chunk size of 768 tokens has led to issues including excessive detail, information redundancy, dilution of focus within extracted graph communities, and ambiguous entity resolution.\n\n**Your Task:** You will analyze provided text and determine the most effective `chunk_size` for graph construction. Your decision-making process must directly address the observed issues and aim to produce a graph that clearly represents narrative arcs, key entities, and their relationships.\n\n**Reasoning Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Atomicity vs. Granularity:** Prioritize chunk sizes that capture atomic units of information (specific events, focused interactions) over large narrative segments. Avoid chunk sizes that are so large they encompass multiple distinct plot points or character introductions, as this leads to redundant and unfocused graph communities.\n2.  **Redundancy Mitigation:** A smaller `chunk_size` (e.g., 256-512 tokens) is generally preferred. This minimizes overlap between chunks, preventing duplicate information from diluting the graph structure and leading to redundant communities.\n3.  **Entity Resolution Clarity:** Smaller, more focused chunks improve LLM's ability to resolve entity coreferences and contextualize mentions. This leads to a more precise graph, reducing confusion between similar entities.\n4.  **Community Cohesion:** The goal is to extract information that allows for the formation of coherent communities representing distinct narrative threads or character arcs. A well-chosen `chunk_size` will facilitate the clear representation of relationships, preventing abstract or disconnected summaries.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nProvide a JSON object containing the recommended `chunk_size` and a concise `reasoning` string explaining your choice.\n\n**Example Reasoning:** \"The narrative contains complex character interactions and plot developments that could lead to redundancy with larger chunks. A smaller chunk size of 256 tokens will promote more atomic information capture, reduce redundancy in graph communities, and enhance entity resolution, leading to a clearer representation of the story's plot.\"\n\n**Constraint:** The `chunk_size` must be an integer between 128 and 1024.\n\nBegin analysis and provide your recommendation.",

  "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chunk size of 768 appears to be a significant contributor to the observed issues in the GraphRAG system, particularly concerning redundancy and the inclusion of overly granular details.\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (768):**\n\n1.  **Excessive Detail per Chunk Leading to Redundancy:** A chunk size of 768 tokens is quite large. This means that when the system processes the input text, it's likely capturing a substantial amount of narrative within each chunk. For a story, this can lead to:\n    *   **Overlapping Information:** Different chunks might cover very similar plot points or character introductions, especially if there are scene changes or shifts in focus that don't neatly align with chunk boundaries. This directly contributes to the identified redundancy in Communities 2 and 10, where \"Doctor Von Mark\" and his pursuer are discussed in separate, yet similar, contexts.\n    *   **Difficulty in Distinguishing Key Entities:** With large chunks, a single chunk might contain multiple distinct entities and their relationships. When these chunks are then processed for graph extraction, the resulting graph might struggle to prioritize or even accurately delineate the most important relationships versus incidental ones. This could explain why Community 4, while containing some relevant world-building, also includes overly specific, likely irrelevant details like the \"spotted narl.\"\n\n2.  **Dilution of Focus within Communities:** A larger chunk size can result in broader, less focused graph structures being extracted. When graph merging occurs, if chunks with similar but not identical information are merged, the resulting community summary might become a blend of distinct plot threads. This can explain why Community 6 (Bird's Journey) feels abstract and disconnected – it might be derived from chunks that touched upon the bird but didn't explicitly link it to Noork's journey in a way that the graph extraction could easily represent as a strong relationship.\n\n3.  **Increased Ambiguity in Entity Resolution:** When LLMs process larger chunks, they might have a harder time resolving entity coreferences or understanding the precise context of an entity's mention. This can lead to ambiguities in the graph structure, such as the confusion between \"Captain Dietrich\" and \"Stephen Dietrich\" in Communities 2 and 10. A smaller chunk size would likely isolate these mentions to more specific contexts, potentially aiding in clearer entity resolution during graph construction.\n\n**Recommendation for Chunk Size Improvement:**\n\nA smaller chunk size (e.g., 256-512 tokens) would likely be more beneficial. This would encourage:\n\n*   **More Atomic Information:** Each chunk would focus on a more specific event, character interaction, or piece of information.\n*   **Reduced Redundancy:** Less overlap between chunks means less duplicated information being fed into the graph construction.\n*   **Clearer Entity Relationships:** Smaller, focused chunks can lead to more precise relationships being captured in the graph, making it easier to build coherent communities and for the agent to select relevant ones.\n*   **Improved Narrative Cohesion:** By breaking down the text into smaller, more manageable units, the graph extraction and summarization process might be better equipped to identify and represent the core narrative threads, like explicitly connecting the bird's journey to Noork's.\n\nThis would directly address the issues of redundant communities, overly granular details, and abstract summaries, leading to a more focused and effective GraphRAG system for answering \"What is the plot of the story?\".",
  "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The current prompt for graph construction has several limitations that hinder the generation of a coherent plot summary, as evidenced by the critique of the resulting graph and retrieval plan.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique and how it relates to the prompt:\n\n**1. Lack of Narrative Cohesion & Hierarchy:**\n\n*   **Prompt Issue:** The prompt focuses on identifying *all* entities and relationships without explicit guidance on prioritizing or weighting them based on narrative importance. The constraints of \"no more than 20 entities and 30 relationships\" are arbitrary and don't account for the complexity of a plot. This leads to a flat graph where tangential or minor plotlines can become as prominent as the main narrative.\n*   **Critique Reflection:** The critique highlights disparate communities and the absence of a narrative hierarchy. This is a direct consequence of the prompt not instructing the LLM to identify a central protagonist or primary conflict to guide entity and relationship extraction.\n\n**2. Ambiguity and Contradiction Handling:**\n\n*   **Prompt Issue:** The prompt asks for entities, types, properties, relationships, descriptions, and evidence. It doesn't provide a mechanism for handling conflicting information about the *same* entity across different parts of the text or different chunks. The LLM is not instructed to reconcile or flag discrepancies.\n*   **Critique Reflection:** The critique points out specific contradictions (Von Mark's motivations, Tholon Sarna's status). The prompt's structure implicitly encourages a single, unified representation for each entity, making it difficult to capture nuances or evolving states.\n\n**3. Insufficient Focus on Causality and Motivation:**\n\n*   **Prompt Issue:** While the prompt asks for relationship descriptions and evidence, it doesn't explicitly ask the LLM to infer *why* entities are related or to focus on causal links and character motivations. The emphasis is on descriptive attributes and explicit relationships.\n*   **Critique Reflection:** The critique states that summaries are descriptive lists and lack causal illumination. This suggests the prompt should push for a deeper analysis of \"why\" events happen and \"why\" characters act, rather than just \"what\" happened.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Significance:** Instruct the LLM to identify the main protagonist(s) and primary conflict(s) first. Then, guide entity and relationship extraction to prioritize elements that directly contribute to these central narrative threads. Consider a weighting system or different prompt sections for main vs. secondary plot elements.\n2.  **Introduce Discrepancy Handling:** Explicitly instruct the LLM to identify and flag conflicting information about entities. This could involve creating separate nodes for different versions/states of an entity, linked with a \"contradicts\" or \"evolves_to\" relationship, or adding a specific \"conflict_status\" property.\n3.  **Emphasize Causal and Motivational Links:** Modify the relationship extraction instructions to specifically ask for the underlying motivations, causes, and effects. For example, include a \"motivation\" field for relationships between characters and an \"effect\" field for event-related relationships.\n4.  **Refine Granularity and Specificity:** Encourage the LLM to be more specific in entity types and relationship descriptions, especially when dealing with similar entities or recurring events. Add instructions to differentiate temporal aspects of entities and relationships.",
  "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The community selection prompt is functional but can be significantly improved to yield more coherent and relevant community choices for the GraphRAG system. The current selection, while broad, suffers from redundancy, unclear narrative integration, and a lack of focus on primary plot drivers.\n\n**Critique Points:**\n\n1.  **Redundancy in Doctor Von Mark's Narrative (Communities 2 & 10):**\n    *   **Issue:** Communities 2 and 10 both detail Doctor Von Mark's activities, his pursuit by an antagonist, and his ambitions (Earth conquest vs. restoring Nazidom). This overlap creates ambiguity regarding the pursuer's identity (Captain Dietrich vs. Stephen Dietrich) and Von Mark's precise objectives.\n    *   **Impact:** The LLM agent is presented with largely identical information, increasing processing load without adding distinct value. This redundancy can lead to conflicting details in the generated answer.\n    *   **Improvement:** These communities should be merged or one should be clearly prioritized and the other discarded. The prompt should encourage the agent to identify and consolidate overlapping storylines to create a singular, comprehensive summary of a key character arc.\n\n2.  **Lack of Clear Narrative Connection for Supporting Communities (Community 4):**\n    *   **Issue:** Community 4 (\"Exiles, Enslavement, and the Valley Cities\") provides granular details about specific characters (Gurn, Sarna) and city conflicts (Grath vs. Tholon Sarna). While potentially part of the world-building, its direct relevance to the main plot of Noork (Community 1) or Von Mark (Communities 2/10) is not immediately apparent from the summary alone. The \"spotted narl\" incident is too specific.\n    *   **Impact:** The agent may select this community based on keyword matches (\"Grath\" appearing in Community 1) but struggle to integrate its details meaningfully into the overall plot summary.\n    *   **Improvement:** The prompt could guide the agent to prioritize communities that offer direct plot progression, character motivations, or conflict resolution relevant to the *main* protagonists/antagonists. Filtering for high-level plot impact is crucial.\n\n3.  **Abstract and Disconnected Event Summary (Community 6):**\n    *   **Issue:** Community 6 (\"Bird's Journey and Fiery Fate\") describes an event involving a bird, a cliff, and fire. This is highly abstract (\"someone,\" \"fire rises to devour the bird\"). Its connection to Noork's journey, where a \"giant bird\" is mentioned in Community 1, is implicit but not explicit.\n    *   **Impact:** The agent might overlook this community due to its vagueness or select it without understanding its specific role in the narrative.\n    *   **Improvement:** The prompt should encourage the agent to identify potential links between abstract events and concrete character actions. If a \"bird\" is a known plot device for a protagonist (Noork), the agent should be more inclined to select and integrate such a community. The summarization of communities should also strive to reduce such abstractions.\n\n4.  **Insufficient Guidance on Prioritization and Integration:**\n    *   **Issue:** The prompt states, \"Select the communities that are most relevant to answering the query. Choose communities that together provide comprehensive coverage of the information needed.\" This is good, but the agent still selected highly overlapping and disconnected communities.\n    *   **Impact:** The agent's current reasoning shows an attempt at broad coverage but fails to critically assess the quality of that coverage (redundancy, integration).\n    *   **Improvement:** The prompt could be refined to explicitly ask the agent to:\n        *   \"Identify and consolidate redundant information across communities.\"\n        *   \"Prioritize communities that directly advance the main plotlines of key characters.\"\n        *   \"Ensure selected communities offer distinct and complementary narrative elements, avoiding excessive overlap or disconnected subplots.\"\n\n**Overall Recommendation:**\n\nThe prompt needs to implicitly or explicitly guide the LLM agent to perform a more sophisticated analysis than simple keyword matching or broad coverage. It should encourage:\n*   **Narrative Cohesion:** Identifying and merging overlapping storylines.\n*   **Plot Relevance:** Prioritizing information that directly contributes to understanding the main plot.\n*   **Entity Resolution:** Clarifying ambiguities between similar entities (e.g., different versions of pursuers).\n*   **Integration:** Linking abstract events to concrete character actions.\n\nBy incorporating these points, the prompt can steer the agent towards selecting a more focused, coherent, and actionable set of communities for the answer generation LLM.",
  "answer_generation_critique": "This is a good starting point, but the current prompt is too general and doesn't effectively guide the LLM to overcome the identified weaknesses.

Your task is to synthesize the retrieved graph information into a coherent and engaging plot summary that directly answers the user's query,\" is too broad. While it sets a general role and task, it lacks the specific guidance needed to address the issues highlighted in the feedback, particularly cohesion, clarity, and prioritizing key plot elements.\n\n**Specific Areas for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Enhancing Cohesion and Narrative Flow:**\n    *   **Issue:** The feedback notes a lack of flow, with abrupt shifts between plot threads.\n    *   **Prompt Suggestion:** The prompt needs to explicitly instruct the LLM to *weave* the information into a *single narrative arc*. Instead of just \"synthesize,\" use stronger verbs.\n    *   **Revised Prompt Wording:** Add a specific instruction like: \"**Structure the summary chronologically or thematically, ensuring smooth transitions between characters, events, and plotlines. Explicitly state connections between seemingly disparate elements, explaining how they contribute to the overall story.**\"\n\n2.  **Addressing Ambiguity and Conflicting Information:**\n    *   **Issue:** The feedback points out inconsistent naming, speculative language (\"It appears\"), and unresolved questions.\n    *   **Prompt Suggestion:** The prompt should direct the LLM to *resolve ambiguities* where possible and *highlight* critical ambiguities *only if they are central to the plot's mystery*. It should also discourage speculative phrasing.\n    *   **Revised Prompt Wording:** Incorporate: \"**If retrieved information presents conflicting details about characters or events, attempt to reconcile them into the most plausible narrative. If irreconcilable, present the dominant narrative thread or note the critical ambiguity if it serves the plot's intrigue. Avoid speculative language; present information definitively based on the provided context.**\"\n\n3.  **Prioritizing Key Plot Elements and Conciseness:**\n    *   **Issue:** The current summary includes minor details (spotted narl attack) and doesn't clearly prioritize the *central* storyline.\n    *   **Prompt Suggestion:** The prompt needs to emphasize focus on the *main conflict* and *protagonist's journey*.\n    *   **Revised Prompt Wording:** Refine existing instructions: \"**Focus on the core narrative: the protagonist's main goal, the primary antagonist(s), the central conflict, and key turning points. Distinguish between essential plot drivers and secondary details. Discard or subordinate minor events unless they directly impact the main plot progression.**\"\n\n4.  **Clarifying Character Roles and Motivations:**\n    *   **Issue:** Character motivations (e.g., Noork's search for the bird) and relationships (e.g., inter-city conflicts) are mentioned but not fully integrated or explained in terms of their plot significance.\n    *   **Prompt Suggestion:** Explicitly ask the LLM to identify and explain these.\n    *   **Revised Prompt Wording:** Add: \"**Clearly define the primary protagonist(s) and antagonist(s), their core motivations, and their relationships. Explain the significance of key conflicts and subplots to the main narrative.**\"\n\n5.  **Handling Sensitive Content:**\n    *   **Issue:** The mention of \"Nazidom\" is problematic if not central.\n    *   **Prompt Suggestion:** Provide guidance on how to handle potentially sensitive or anachronistic terms.\n    *   **Revised Prompt Wording:** Include: \"**When encountering potentially sensitive or anachronistic terms, present them neutrally as character goals or plot elements if essential, otherwise omit them for clarity and relevance to the core plot.**\"\n\nBy integrating these specific directives, the prompt can better guide the LLM to produce a more coherent, focused, and accurate plot summary, directly addressing the shortcomings identified in the example.",
