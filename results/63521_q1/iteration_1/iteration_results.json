It doesn't invent information.\n*   **Identification of Missing Elements:** It correctly points out the absence of a coherent narrative structure (beginning, rising action, etc.).\n*   **Clear Explanation of Requirements:** It clearly explains what kind of information would be needed to answer the query effectively.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Proactivity:** It doesn't attempt to synthesize even the *partial* information available to give the user *something*. The user asked \"What is the plot?\", not \"Can you summarize the plot?\" The response could have at least offered a partial summary of the *events* that have occurred, even if they don't form a complete plot.\n*   **Slightly Repetitive:** The phrasing \"does not present a coherent narrative or a summary of the overall plot\" and \"Therefore, the plot of the story cannot be determined from the given information\" are very similar.\n*   **Could Be More Actionable:** While it states what's needed, it doesn't offer to *try* and assemble what it has, or suggest how the user might go about extracting plot elements from the fragmented data.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to make the response more helpful by acknowledging what *can* be done with the provided fragments, even if a full plot summary isn't possible.\n\nHere are a few ways to improve the response, ranging from minor tweaks to more significant additions:\n\n**Improvement 1: Acknowledge and Synthesize Partial Information**\n\nInstead of just saying \"the plot cannot be determined,\" try to summarize the *events* that *are* described. This gives the user a sense of what the story *is about*, even if it's not a full plot.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information details several key events and actions involving the character Noork. These include his arrival on Sekk, his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory, engaging in fights with guards, utilizing disguises, and interacting with characters such as Sarna, Gurn, and Doctor Von Mark.\n>\n> While these events offer glimpses into Noork's journey and the world he inhabits, they do not currently form a complete narrative or a cohesive plot summary. To determine the overall plot, information outlining the story's beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution would be necessary.\n>\n> Based on the fragments available, it appears to be an action-oriented story centered around Noork's mission or activities on Sekk, involving espionage and conflict.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It still clearly states the limitation but offers a preliminary understanding of the story's *content*.\n*   It uses phrases like \"glimpses into Noork's journey\" and \"appears to be an action-oriented story\" to provide context without overstating what's known.\n\n**Improvement 2: Offer to Extract Specific Plot Elements (if possible)**\n\nIf the RAG system has the capability, it could offer to try and identify specific plot-related elements, even if it can't assemble them into a whole.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information describes several significant events, such as Noork's arrival on Sekk, his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory, and confrontations with guards. We also see interactions with characters like Sarna, Gurn, and Doctor Von Mark, suggesting Noork is involved in some form of mission or investigation.\n>\n> However, these details do not currently coalesce into a complete plot summary, as the overarching narrative structure (beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution) is not discernible from the given text.\n>\n> To fully understand the plot, we would need a more comprehensive overview. Would you like me to try and extract specific plot-related elements from the text, such as:\n>\n> *   Noork's primary goal?\n> *   The main conflict?\n> *   Key turning points mentioned?\n>\n> Alternatively, if you can provide more narrative context, I can offer a more complete plot summary.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It's more proactive and user-centric, offering tangible next steps.\n*   It empowers the user to guide the information extraction.\n\n**Improvement 3: Combine Acknowledgement with a Prompt for More Information (Slightly more direct)**\n\nThis version is a bit more direct about the need for more information but still tries to be helpful.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The information available describes a series of actions and events involving Noork on Sekk, including his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory and encounters with guards and other characters like Sarna and Gurn.\n>\n> However, these details, while illustrative, do not constitute a full plot summary. A coherent narrative arc, encompassing the beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution, is not present in the provided text. Therefore, the complete plot of the story cannot be definitively determined.\n>\n> To provide you with the plot, I would need information that outlines the story's progression. If you can provide a more narrative summary or specific plot points, I would be happy to synthesize them.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It's concise while still acknowledging the content.\n*   It clearly states the limitation and the need for more information in a direct but polite manner.\n\n**General Considerations for RAG Responses on Plot:**\n\n*   **Prioritize \"What is known\" over \"What is missing\":** Even if a full plot isn't available, telling the user *what the story seems to be about* is more helpful than just saying \"I don't know.\"\n*   **Offer to Extrapolate or Summarize Fragments:** If the RAG system can identify themes, character motivations (even if partial), or key events, it should offer to present these.\n*   **Be Specific About What's Needed:** Instead of just saying \"a coherent narrative,\" list the components of a plot (beginning, rising action, etc.) as the original response did.\n*   **Maintain a Helpful Tone:** Even when unable to fully answer, the response should aim to guide the user towards getting the information they need.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can provide a more comprehensive and helpful answer, even when faced with incomplete source material.",

      "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chunk size of 500 appears to be a reasonable starting point, but it may contribute to some of the identified limitations in narrative coherence.\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (500):**\n\n*   **Potential for Fragmented Events:** A chunk size of 500 words might be too small to contain complete narrative arcs or significant event sequences. Crucial plot points, character developments, or causal relationships that span across the 500-word boundary could be split. This forces the graph extraction process to infer connections between separate chunks, increasing the likelihood of incomplete or disjointed subgraphs. For instance, if a character's motivation to act is explained in one chunk and their subsequent action occurs in the next, the LLM extracting the graph might miss the direct causal link if the chunk boundary falls between them.\n\n*   **Over-reliance on Cross-Chunk Inference:** When significant plot elements are split across chunks, the graph merging process becomes more critical and potentially error-prone. The system then relies heavily on the LLM's ability to infer connections between entities and events mentioned in different, non-contiguous chunks. This can lead to less precise relationships and a weaker overall narrative structure, contributing to the critique's point about \"Lack of Explicit Event Sequencing.\" The current graph exhibits many granular relationships, suggesting that many individual pieces of information were extracted, but their interconnections across larger narrative structures might be weakened by chunking.\n\n*   **Limited Context for Entity Roles:** A 500-word chunk may not always provide sufficient context to fully define the significance of an entity within the broader narrative. For example, a character's role as a protagonist or antagonist, or a location's importance as a \"turning point,\" might be established over a longer discourse. If this context is split across chunks, the graph extraction LLM might only capture a limited aspect of the entity, leading to the critique point about \"Contextual Depth for Key Entities.\"\n\n**Recommendation for Improvement:**\n\nConsider experimenting with larger chunk sizes (e.g., 750-1000 words) or adaptive chunking strategies. Larger chunks could help preserve narrative flow and causal links within individual chunks, reducing the fragmentation of events and character motivations. This would allow the graph extraction LLM to better capture complete interactions and their immediate consequences, leading to a more coherent and narratively sound graph. The goal is to find a balance where chunks are large enough to contain meaningful narrative units but not so large as to overwhelm the LLM's processing capacity or introduce excessive noise.",
      "graph_builder_agent_critique": "This prompt for graph construction in GraphRAG exhibits several weaknesses that hinder the creation of a narrative-rich graph suitable for plot-focused queries.\n\n**1. Overemphasis on Granular Entity Properties vs. Narrative Relationships:**\nThe prompt instructs the LLM to extract detailed `properties` for each entity (e.g., \"age, role, description\"). While useful for general knowledge graphs, this level of detail often distracts from identifying the core narrative actions and causal links that drive a plot. The sheer volume of property extraction can dilute the focus on crucial relationships.\n\n**2. Lack of Explicit Instruction for Plot-Relevant Relationships:**\nThe prompt is too generic in its request for \"all the relationships.\" It doesn't guide the LLM to prioritize or identify relationships that are essential for understanding narrative progression. Relationships like `causes`, `leads to`, `initiates event`, `conflict with`, or `sequence of` are not prompted for, leading to a graph that is descriptive rather than dynamic.\n\n**3. Undervaluing Event Representation:**\nThe prompt doesn't specifically guide the LLM to represent events as distinct, connectable nodes. While entities are requested, events, which are the building blocks of a plot, are not emphasized as first-class citizens that can be linked to characters and other events via plot-driving relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`).\n\n**4. Entity-Centric Bias:**\nThe prompt's structure naturally leads to an entity-centric graph. The focus is on identifying entities and then finding relationships *among* them. This contrasts with a narrative-centric approach where the *actions* and *sequences of events* involving entities are the primary focus, dictating the structure of the graph.\n\n**5. Ambiguity in Relationship Definition:**\nWhile the prompt asks for a `description` of why entities are related and `evidence`, the breadth of this request, combined with the lack of specific plot-oriented relationship types, results in the fragmentation observed in the generated graph (many relationship types with few instances). This suggests the LLM is inferring many tangential connections rather than focusing on the core narrative.\n\nIn summary, the prompt needs to be reframed to prioritize the extraction of causal and sequential relationships that define a plot, rather than focusing excessively on granular entity properties and a broad, unprioritized set of general relationships. The LLM should be instructed to identify and represent events and their connections more prominently.",
      "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The current retrieval plan, while exhibiting a systematic approach to graph exploration, fails to effectively construct a coherent narrative for the \"plot of the story\" query.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Synthesis:** The primary failing is the inability to weave individual retrieved facts (events, character actions) into a story. The process retrieves a series of related nodes and edges but does not assemble them into a chronological or causal sequence, which is the essence of a plot. For example, identifying \"Noork fights guards\" and \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards\" without linking them causally or temporally results in disconnected data points.\n\n2.  **Over-reliance on `get_neighbors` without Narrative Direction:** The repeated use of `get_neighbors` on entities like \"Noork\" or specific events, while a valid exploration technique, lacks a guiding strategy to build the plot. It often retrieves a wide array of connections without a clear mechanism to prioritize those that advance the narrative. This leads to a \"laundry list\" of information rather than a structured story.\n\n3.  **Inconsistent Focus on Plot Relevance:** As the exploration progresses, the retrieved context seems to gather tangential information (e.g., \"Greg Weeks,\" \"Planet Stories Summer 1945\") that, while potentially present in the source text, does not directly contribute to understanding the core narrative arc of \"the plot.\" The plan needs a stronger mechanism to filter for information that directly advances the story's progression.\n\n4.  **Absence of Plot Structure Awareness:** The retrieval strategy does not seem to be guided by an understanding of narrative structure (e.g., inciting incident, rising action, climax, resolution). The exploration is broad rather than targeted at identifying key plot points and their interdependencies.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Causal and Temporal Relationships:** The prompt should encourage the agent to actively seek relationships that establish cause-and-effect or temporal order between events and actions. This involves looking for specific relation types that indicate sequence or consequence.\n*   **Develop a Narrative Thread Strategy:** Instead of just exploring neighbors, the agent should be prompted to follow specific narrative threads. For instance, after an event, it should prioritize finding the *outcome* or the *next significant action* related to it.\n*   **Implement Targeted Information Gathering:** The agent should be guided to identify and prioritize nodes and relationships that are central to the protagonist's journey or the main conflict. This could involve searching for common themes or recurring entities within event descriptions.\n*   **Refine `get_neighbors` usage:** When using `get_neighbors`, the agent should be instructed to analyze the *types* of neighbors and relationships retrieved, prioritizing those that are likely to contribute to the plot (e.g., other \"Event\" nodes, \"Person\" nodes with \"antagonist\" relationships, \"Location\" nodes where key actions occur).",
      "answer_generation_critique": "## Prompt Critique and Feedback:\n\nThe current prompt is functional but has several areas for improvement to generate more helpful and proactive responses, especially when information is insufficient. The core issue is its passive nature when faced with incomplete data.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Insufficient Synthesis of Available Information:** The prompt instructs the model to state *why* information is insufficient but not to synthesize *what is available*. The feedback highlights this: \"It stops short of offering any constructive next steps or demonstrating what *could* be done with the available information, even if it's just a fragmented overview.\" The current prompt leads to answers that simply state what's missing, rather than what *can* be inferred or summarized from the fragments.\n\n2.  **Lack of Proactive Guidance on Partial Answers:** While the prompt suggests offering \"related details that *can* be answered,\" it doesn't explicitly encourage the model to *attempt* to construct even a partial answer or thematic summary from the retrieved information. For a query like \"What is the plot?\", the user likely wants *some* understanding of the story, even if incomplete. The current prompt results in a denial of service rather than a best-effort attempt.\n\n3.  **Vague \"Guide the user\" Instruction:** The prompt says to \"Suggest the type of additional information that would be needed.\" While the example response does this by listing plot components, the prompt could be more explicit in encouraging this, perhaps by suggesting the model infer what *kind* of missing information would complete the picture (e.g., \"To understand the plot, we'd need to know the protagonist's primary motivation,\" or \"The events described suggest a conflict, but the stakes are unclear\").\n\n4.  **Overly Cautious on \"Offering Alternatives\":** The instruction \"Offer to provide related details that *can* be answered\" is good, but it's not sufficiently pushed. The feedback notes that the model \"doesn't attempt to synthesize even the *partial* information available to give the user *something*.\" The prompt should encourage a more active attempt to build a partial picture.\n\n**Prompt Improvement Suggestions:**\n\nTo address these points, the prompt could be modified to:\n\n1.  **Emphasize Partial Synthesis:** Add an instruction like: \"Even if a complete answer cannot be formed, attempt to synthesize the provided `Information` to offer a partial summary, identify key themes, or describe discernible events.\"\n\n2.  **Encourage Best-Effort Storytelling:** Explicitly state: \"If the `Information` does not form a complete plot, describe the fragments of the story that *are* present, highlighting discernible characters, actions, settings, or conflicts.\"\n\n3.  **Strengthen \"Guide the User\":** Rephrase: \"If the `Information` is insufficient, clearly state the limitations and *specifically* explain what narrative elements are missing (e.g., the inciting incident, the climax, character motivations). Suggest the types of information needed to complete the narrative arc.\"\n\n4.  **Integrate Proactivity:** Combine the synthesis and guidance: \"When information is insufficient, first synthesize the available fragments into a coherent overview of what is known. Then, explain what is missing for a complete answer, and suggest the types of information required to bridge those gaps.\"\n\nBy incorporating these changes, the prompt will guide the LLM to be more resourceful and user-centric, providing more value even when the retrieved information is fragmented.",
