    "evaluation_feedback": "**Evaluation of the Response:**\n\nThe response, \"The provided information indicates that the graph is empty, meaning there is no data to describe a plot,\" is **partially correct but ultimately unhelpful and incomplete** given the query \"What is the plot of the story?\".\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Correctness:** The response correctly identifies that if the *provided information* is an empty graph, then there's no plot *within that specific data representation*.\n*   **Unhelpfulness:** The core issue is that the response directly answers a question about a \"story's plot\" by referring to an \"empty graph.\" This implies a misunderstanding of what a \"plot\" typically refers to in the context of a story. A story's plot is its sequence of events, characters, and conflicts, not necessarily a visual representation like a graph.\n*   **Incompleteness:** Even if the user *intended* to ask about a plot represented by a graph (which is unlikely given the phrasing), the response simply states it's empty. It doesn't offer any further context or clarification.\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n\nThe RAG system needs to better understand the user's intent and adapt its response based on the *nature* of the retrieved information.\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, categorized by the likely scenario the RAG system encountered:\n\n**Scenario 1: The RAG system retrieved a document *about* a story, but the RAG system *interpreted* this document as an \"empty graph\" or similar irrelevant data.**\n\n*   **Improvement:** The RAG system should be trained to recognize narrative text. Instead of saying \"empty graph,\" it should extract and summarize the actual plot.\n    *   **Revised Response Example:** \"The story's plot revolves around [Character Name], who [initial situation]. The main conflict arises when [inciting incident]. Throughout the story, [Character Name] faces challenges such as [key events/obstacles], leading to a climax where [climax event]. Ultimately, the story concludes with [resolution].\"\n\n**Scenario 2: The RAG system *did* retrieve information that could be *interpreted* as a graph, but this graph *is not* relevant to a story's plot.**\n\n*   **Improvement:** The RAG system should acknowledge the retrieved data but also explain *why* it doesn't answer the question about a story's plot. It should then attempt to find relevant information if possible.\n    *   **Revised Response Example:** \"The information I found describes an empty data graph. This doesn't contain details about a story's plot. Could you please provide more context about the story you're interested in, or perhaps the source of information you'd like me to analyze?\"\n    *   **Even Better:** \"The information I have access to appears to be an empty graph, which doesn't provide details about the plot of a story. If you're referring to a specific story, please provide its title or some key details, and I'll do my best to find information about its plot.\"\n\n**Scenario 3: The RAG system *correctly* identified that the only retrieved information was an \"empty graph\" and there was no other relevant text about a story.**\n\n*   **Improvement:** The RAG system should clearly state what it found (or didn't find) and explain why it cannot answer the question. It should also guide the user on how to get a better answer.\n    *   **Revised Response Example:** \"I couldn't find any information related to the plot of a story in the data I accessed. The information I have is an empty graph, which doesn't describe narrative events. To help me answer your question, please provide the title of the story or more context.\"\n    *   **More Proactive:** \"I couldn't locate any information about a story's plot within the provided data. The data appears to be an empty graph. If you have a specific story in mind, please tell me its title or describe it, and I can try to find its plot summary for you.\"\n\n**General Principles for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Intent Recognition:** The RAG system needs to be better at understanding the *intent* behind the query. \"Plot of the story\" strongly suggests a narrative, not data visualization.\n2.  **Contextual Relevance:** Even if the retrieved data is \"an empty graph,\" the system should explain *why* that data is irrelevant to the user's question about a story.\n3.  **Information Synthesis:** If the RAG system retrieves actual text about a story, it should be able to synthesize this information into a coherent plot summary.\n4.  **Clarification and Guidance:** If the RAG system cannot answer the question, it should clearly explain *why* and guide the user",

Your goal is to determine the most effective `chunk_size` parameter for constructing knowledge graphs from a given document.\n\nThe core challenge is to balance the granularity of information extraction with the need to preserve narrative structure, contextual cohesion, and the ability to infer relationships between events and entities.\n\n**Critique of current approach:**\n*   **Limited Contextual Cohesion:** A small `chunk_size` (e.g., 150 tokens) can lead to fragmented graphs, isolating events and actions. This hinders the identification of longer causal chains and complex interactions across different parts of the document.\n*   **Difficulty in Inferring Narrative Structures:** Small chunks make it hard to capture sequential or causal plot elements. This can result in graphs lacking the interconnectedness needed to represent overarching narrative structures or find explicit \"Story\" or \"Plot\" nodes.\n*   **Potential Information Dilution:** With small chunks, LLMs may over-generalize or lose subtle narrative details that would be apparent in a larger context, impacting the richness of extracted relationships (e.g., `participates in`, `precedes`).\n\n**Your Task:**\nWhen presented with a document, analyze its characteristics to recommend an optimal `chunk_size`. Consider the following factors in your reasoning:\n\n1.  **Narrative Complexity:** Does the document describe a linear sequence of events, a complex plot with subplots, or a more static informational piece? More complex narratives benefit from larger chunk sizes to maintain cohesion.\n2.  **Entity Interactions:** How frequently do entities (characters, concepts, etc.) interact, and how spread out are these interactions within the text? Densely interconnected entities might require larger chunks to capture their relationships effectively.\n3.  **Information Density and Granularity:** Is the information presented in dense, detail-rich paragraphs, or is it more spread out with clear topic shifts? Dense information might benefit from smaller chunks, while spread-out information might require larger ones to connect related ideas.\n4.  **Document Length and Structure:** The overall length and how the document is structured (e.g., chapters, sections) can influence the ideal chunk size. Longer documents might benefit from a chunk size that allows for broader thematic connections.\n5.  **Relationship Types:** Prioritize extracting richer, more nuanced relationships (e.g., temporal, causal, hierarchical).

      "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 150 tokens, while not explicitly stated as problematic in the provided critique, likely contributes to the issues identified. The critique focuses on the *lack of narrative structure representation* and the *ineffective handling of missing information* due to an over-reliance on abstract node types. The chunk size plays a role in how information is compartmentalized, which in turn impacts the granularity of the extracted graph and the ability to infer higher-level narrative elements.\n\nHere's a critique of the chunk size in relation to the identified problems:\n\n1.  **Limited Contextual Cohesion within Chunks:** A chunk size of 150 tokens is relatively small. This means that a single chunk might only capture a very localized event or a small piece of dialogue. Consequently, when graphs are extracted from these small chunks, they are likely to be very specific and fragmented. It becomes difficult for the graph to implicitly represent longer causal chains or complex interactions between characters across different scenes if those interactions span multiple chunks. The critique highlights the need to represent *events* and *actions* with temporal or causal relationships. A small chunk size makes it harder to identify these relationships if they require a broader context than 150 tokens.\n\n2.  **Difficulty in Inferring Overarching Narrative Structures:** The critique points out that the graph doesn't capture the sequential or causal nature of a plot and that the system fails when searching for explicit \"Story\" or \"Plot\" nodes. If information pertaining to a single plot point, character motivation, or event sequence is scattered across many small chunks, the extracted graphs will lack the necessary interconnectedness to form a coherent narrative. The LLM agent, when exploring such a fragmented graph, would struggle to piece together the larger story, as the relationships and events extracted from individual chunks might be too isolated.\n\n3.  **Potential for Information Dilution or Loss:** With a smaller chunk size, the LLM tasked with graph extraction from each chunk might be forced to make more assumptions or generalizations to create a graph that is meaningful within its limited context. This could lead to the loss of subtle but important narrative details that, if combined with information from adjacent chunks, would form a richer representation. The critique mentions the need for more diverse relationship types like `participates in` or `precedes`. These richer relationships are more likely to be identifiable when a larger contiguous block of text is considered, allowing the LLM to see the actions and participants in a more complete context.\n\n**",
      "graph_builder_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the graph construction prompt and advice for improvement, focusing on narrative representation:\n\n**Critique of the Current Prompt:**\n\nThe current prompt for graph construction, while aiming to extract entities and relationships, falls short in capturing the dynamic and sequential nature of narrative content. Its primary weaknesses are:\n\n1.  **Focus on Static Entities:** The prompt heavily emphasizes extracting static entities (Person, Organization, Location, Concept) and their intrinsic properties. While important, this overlooks the core of a narrative: *events* and *actions*. The prompt doesn't explicitly ask for the identification of events, states, or plot points as distinct entities.\n2.  **Limited Relationship Types for Narrative Flow:** The requested relationship types (e.g., \"possesses,\" \"attacks\") are too generic and don't adequately represent the causal, temporal, or intentional links that drive a story. There's no mechanism to capture \"happens before,\" \"causes,\" \"motivates,\" or \"participates in\" relationships between events and characters.\n3.  **Implicit Plot Construction:** The prompt expects a graph to be built from which a plot can *then* be inferred. However, without explicit instructions to identify and link events, the resulting graph will likely be a collection of disconnected facts rather than a representation of the narrative's progression. This makes it difficult for downstream agents to reconstruct or understand the plot.\n4.  **Potential for Oversimplification:** The prompt's limitations on entities (20) and relationships (30) per chunk, while seemingly aiming for conciseness, might force the extraction model to prioritize superficial connections over the critical, albeit fewer, narrative links that define the plot.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\nTo better represent narrative content, the prompt should be enhanced to:\n\n1.  **Identify and Model Events/Actions:** Introduce a new entity type, such as `Event` or `Action`. This entity should describe a specific occurrence or action within the narrative.\n    *   **Example Instruction:** \"Identify `Event` entities, describing specific occurrences or actions in the text (e.g., 'battle,' 'discovery,' 'escape').\"\n2.  **Define Narrative-Specific Relationship Types:** Explicitly ask for relationships that capture the flow of a story.\n    *   **Example Instruction:** \"Include relationships such as: `happens_before`, `causes`, `participates_in` (linking a Person to an Event",
      "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The provided retrieval plans demonstrate a consistent and problematic strategy: a rigid adherence to finding explicitly labeled nodes for \"Story\" or keywords like \"story\" and \"plot.\" This approach fails to account for how narrative elements are often implicitly represented within a graph.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Over-reliance on Explicit Labels:** The repeated attempts to find nodes typed as \"Story\" or containing keywords like \"story\" and \"plot\" are overly literal. Narrative structure is rarely captured by a single, explicitly labeled \"story\" node. The system should infer the story's components from relationships between entities like \"Person,\" \"Location,\" and \"Concept.\"\n2.  **Failure to Adapt to Implicit Information:** When direct searches fail (as indicated by empty graph outputs), the system does not pivot to more inferential strategies. It continues to re-run similar failed searches or makes minor keyword adjustments.\n3.  **Missed Opportunity for Relational Exploration:** The query \"What is the plot of the story?\" inherently requires understanding relationships and sequences. The plans neglect to explore core graph exploration functions like `get_neighbors`, `search_relations_by_type`, or `analyze_path`. These are crucial for piecing together a narrative from interconnected entities.\n4.  **Ineffective Handling of \"Empty Graph\" Results:** Repeatedly returning an empty graph without a strategy to bypass this suggests a lack of robustness. Instead of continuing to search for non-existent explicit \"story\" nodes, the system should recognize this and shift focus to exploring the connections *between* existing entities that might constitute plot elements. For example, frequent \"attacks\" or \"possesses\" relationships could hint at narrative progression.\n5.  **Lack of Strategy for Inferring Plot:** The core issue is the absence of a plan to *construct* a plot from graph data. The system appears to be searching for a pre-packaged \"plot\" node, rather than synthesizing information from character interactions, events, and their relationships.\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**\n\nThe retrieval planning prompt should guide the agent to:\n\n*   **Prioritize relational exploration:** When direct searches for narrative nodes fail, immediately pivot to exploring relationships between common entity types (Person, Location, Concept, Object).\n*   **Leverage relationship types:** Focus on high-frequency relationship types (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"possesses,\" \"instructs\") as potential indicators of plot progression.\n*   **Use `get_neighbors` and",
      "answer_generation_critique": "The current prompt is overly focused on *how* to synthesize graph data and assumes the existence of such data. It fails to account for scenarios where the retrieved information is not a graph, or is an empty graph, which is precisely what happened in the example. This leads to a generic and unhelpful response when the core premise (retrieved graph data) is false.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the issues and suggested prompt modifications:\n\n**Critique of Current Prompt:**\n\n1.  **Assumption of Graph Data:** The prompt's opening line, \"You are a specialized AI assistant for a GraphRAG system. Your primary function is to synthesize fragmented information extracted from a knowledge graph into coherent, accurate, and narrative-driven answers,\" immediately sets a context that is broken if no graph is retrieved or if the graph is empty. The subsequent guidelines (Narrative Synthesis, Assertive Fact Stating, Character and Relationship Clarity) are all predicated on the successful extraction and presence of graph data.\n2.  **Lack of Handling for Empty/Irrelevant Data:** There are no instructions within the prompt to handle cases where the graph extraction fails, returns empty, or returns data that is not relevant to the query (e.g., if the query is about a story plot but the graph describes something else entirely). The current prompt implicitly assumes success in graph extraction and relevance.\n3.  **Over-Emphasis on Graph-Specific Tasks:** While the prompt is designed for a GraphRAG system, it doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM to *verify* if the retrieved information is indeed usable graph data before attempting to apply the synthesis rules. This is why the LLM simply stated the graph was empty without further context or attempt to interpret the query's intent.\n4.  **No Guidance on User Intent vs. Data Reality Mismatch:** The prompt doesn't equip the LLM to bridge the gap between a user's query (e.g., \"plot of the story\") and the reality of the retrieved data (e.g., an empty graph). It doesn't tell the LLM to recognize that a story plot is a narrative concept, and an empty graph cannot represent it.\n\n**Proposed Prompt Modifications:**\n\nThe prompt needs to be more robust and include explicit handling for different data retrieval outcomes. It should prioritize understanding the *query intent* and *verifying the retrieved data's relevance and existence* before attempting synthesis.\n\nHere’s how the prompt could be improved:\n\n",
