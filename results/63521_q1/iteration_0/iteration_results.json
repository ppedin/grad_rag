Your task is to provide reasoned recommendations for hyperparameter tuning, specifically focusing on `chunk_size`.\n\nThe goal is to generate a `chunk_size` that maximizes the extraction of coherent and contextually rich narrative elements, enabling the construction of a detailed and accurate knowledge graph.\n\n**Analyze the following context and critique to inform your `chunk_size` recommendation:**\n\n**Critique:**\n*   **Graph Sparsity & Granularity:** The current graph, while connected, exhibits low density (0.0234 with 178 nodes, 369 relationships) and a tendency towards generic entity types with underutilized relationships. This suggests that individual chunks might not contain sufficient contextual information for the LLM to identify and extract nuanced, plot-specific relationships and entities.\n*   **Narrative Cohesion:** The current `chunk_size` (e.g., 250 words) may be fragmenting narrative threads. Crucial information or plot progression might be split across chunks, hindering the LLM's ability to understand the complete context of entities and their relationships within a given narrative segment. This leads to missing plot-specific nodes/relationships and a lack of granular contextualization.\n*   **Relationship Extraction Quality:** Insufficient context within chunks can result in shallow relationship extraction. The LLM might miss more complex, context-dependent relationships if the relevant information is scattered. Conversely, overly large chunks might overwhelm the LLM, leading to a dilution of focus.\n\n**Your Recommendation:**\nBased on this analysis, determine an *optimal `chunk_size`* that balances capturing sufficient narrative context for deep entity/relationship extraction without becoming overly broad. Consider how this `chunk_size` will improve:\n\n1.  **Narrative Thread Cohesion:** Ensure that key plot points, character motivations, and consequential actions remain within a single chunk to support richer graph extraction.\n2.  **Relationship Nuance:** Enable the LLM to identify and extract more specific, context-aware relationships, moving beyond generic types.\n3.  **Entity Contextualization:** Provide enough surrounding text for the LLM to understand the precise role and significance of entities within the narrative segment.\n\n**Output Format:**\nProvide a single integer representing the recommended `chunk_size` (in tokens/words, specify which) and a brief, 1-2 sentence justification referencing the critique points.\n\n**Example Output:**\n",

Your goal is to intelligently explore a knowledge graph to gather information relevant to a user's query, focusing on efficiency and context-awareness.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Context is Key:** Always prioritize using information from previous retrieval steps to inform the next. Avoid redundant searches or starting over. If a node or relationship is crucial to the current context, explore its neighbors and attributes before initiating a broad, new search.\n2.  **Prioritize High-Impact Information:** Begin by identifying entities or relationships likely to be central to the user's query. Consider nodes with many connections, nodes involved in actions (e.g., \"attacked,\" \"created,\" \"uses\"), or key locations mentioned. Avoid overly broad initial searches.\n3.  **Infer, Don't Just Search:** Do not rely solely on literal keywords like \"plot\" or generic node types if better, more specific paths exist. Infer plot drivers from actions, conflicts, and established entities.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Each retrieval step should progressively narrow down the search space and deepen understanding. If a search yields relevant entities, the next step should investigate those entities further.\n\n**Function Usage Guidelines:**\n\n*   `search_nodes_by_keyword(keyword: str)`: Use this to find nodes based on specific terms that are likely to be present in node properties (e.g., names, titles, descriptions). Use this sparingly and preferably after identifying potential entities or concepts.\n*   `search_nodes_by_types(node_type: str)`: Use this to find nodes of a specific category (e.g., 'Person', 'Location', 'Event'). Start with specific types relevant to the query or context, not generic ones without justification.\n*   `search_node_neighbors(node_id: str, relationship_types: Optional[List[str]] = None)`: **Crucial for context.** Use this to explore connections around a node that has been identified as important in a previous step. Specify `relationship_types` if you have a hypothesis about the relevant connections.\n*   `get_node_details(node_id: str)`: Use this to retrieve the properties and attributes of a specific, identified node.\n\n**Planning Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Query & Context:** Understand the user's core question and any information already gathered.\n2.  **Hyp",

      "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chunk size of 250 appears to be a reasonable starting point for this corpus, as evidenced by the graph's respectable size (178 nodes, 369 relationships) and full connectivity. However, the critique of the graph's exploration suggests that the *granularity* of information within chunks might not be optimal for capturing narrative elements.\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size:**\n\nThe primary issue stemming from the chunk size isn't necessarily that it's too large or too small in absolute terms, but rather how it impacts the *cohesion* of information within each chunk.\n\n1.  **Potential for Disjointed Narrative Threads:** A chunk size of 250 words might split crucial narrative elements across multiple chunks. For example, a character's motivation might be introduced early in one chunk, with the subsequent action or consequence appearing in the next. This makes it harder for the LLM to extract a complete, coherent \"storylet\" graph for that chunk, leading to fragmented entity and relationship extraction. The graph critique mentions \"missing plot-specific nodes/relationships\" and \"lack of granularity and contextualization,\" which could be a direct consequence of this fragmentation. If a chunk doesn't contain enough surrounding context, the LLM might struggle to identify the correct relationship types or even recognize the significance of certain entities within that specific narrative segment.\n\n2.  **Impact on Relationship Extraction:** The graph has 178 nodes and 369 relationships. While the density is low (0.0234), suggesting sparsity, the critique points to an \"over-reliance on generic entity types and underutilization of relationships.\" If chunks are too small, they might only contain a few entities and relationships, preventing the LLM from seeing the broader network of connections *within that chunk*. This can lead to the extraction of shallow, direct relationships rather than more complex, context-dependent ones. Conversely, if a chunk is too large and contains too many disparate plot points, the LLM might struggle to focus and identify the most salient relationships.\n\n3.  **Inconsistent Graph Quality Across Chunks:** The effectiveness of GraphRAG hinges on the quality of the graphs extracted from each chunk. If the 250-word chunk size inconsistently captures relevant narrative arcs, the resulting merged graph will be uneven. Some parts might be rich in specific plot details, while others are sparse or contain misinterpretations due to limited context within the chunk. This could explain why",
      "graph_builder_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the provided graph construction prompt, focusing on improving its effectiveness for narrative understanding:\n\n**Critique of the Graph Construction Prompt:**\n\nThe current prompt is too generic and focuses on simply extracting *all* entities and relationships without a clear directive on *narrative significance*. This leads to a graph that is broad but shallow, lacking the specificity needed for tasks like plot summarization.\n\n**Key Issues:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Focus:** The prompt asks for entities and relationships but doesn't guide the LLM to identify elements crucial to a story's progression (e.g., protagonists, antagonists, conflicts, goals, plot points, causal links). Entity types like \"Concept\" are too broad.\n2.  **No Prioritization Mechanism:** It requests \"no more than 20 entities and 30 relationships,\" which is an arbitrary limit that doesn't reflect narrative importance. This can lead to the inclusion of minor details while omitting key plot drivers. The system needs to prioritize nodes and relationships that are central to the narrative.\n3.  **Insufficient Detail for Relationships:** While it asks for a \"description\" and \"evidence,\" it doesn't prompt for the *type* of relationship in a narrative context (e.g., \"causes,\" \"leads to,\" \"opposes,\" \"motivates\"). The sample output shows generic types like \"interacts with\" rather than narrative actions.\n4.  **No Guidance on Properties:** The property extraction is open-ended. For narrative understanding, properties should be geared towards revealing character motivations, plot relevance, or situational context.\n5.  **Missing Hierarchy/Structure:** The prompt doesn't encourage the extraction of hierarchical relationships or temporal sequencing, which are fundamental to understanding plot structure.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Introduce Narrative-Centric Entity Types:** Suggest types like `Protagonist`, `Antagonist`, `KeyCharacter`, `LocationOfSignificance`, `KeyEvent`, `Conflict`, `Goal`, `PlotDevice`, `ObjectOfImportance`.\n2.  **Specify Narrative Relationship Types:** Encourage relationships such as `causes`, `leadsTo`, `intendsTo`, `opposes`, `motivates`, `discovers`, `achieves`, `failsAt`, `occursDuring`, `isLocatedIn`, `isCharacterInvolvedIn`.\n3.  **Incorporate Prioritization Directives:** Instruct the LLM to prioritize entities and relationships that are central",
      "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the provided retrieval plans, focusing on areas for improvement in the retrieval planning prompt:\n\n**Critique of Retrieval Plans and Feedback for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Initial Broadness and Lack of Prioritization:**\n    *   The first step, `search_nodes_by_types(node_type='Person')`, is too broad. While persons are important, fetching all 46 'Person' nodes without any initial filtering or prioritization is inefficient and doesn't effectively narrow down the search for plot elements. The prompt should encourage strategies that start with more focused queries or an understanding of how common entity types relate to plot.\n    *   **Feedback for Prompt:** Emphasize starting with high-impact nodes or relationships. Suggest methods to infer potential plot drivers (e.g., nodes with many incoming/outgoing relationships, nodes involved in \"attacked,\" \"attacks,\" or \"uses\" relationships, which are frequent) rather than simply retrieving the most common entity types.\n\n2.  **Failure to Leverage Established Context and Redundancy:**\n    *   After identifying 'The Doctor' and 'American pilot' trapped on 'Sekk', the subsequent steps *abandon* this contextual information. Instead of exploring 'Sekk' or the relationships of these characters further, the agent resorts to generic keyword searches (`search_nodes_by_keyword(keyword='plot')`) and then node type searches (`search_nodes_by_types(node_type='Story')`).\n    *   Iteration 3, querying neighbors of the 'American pilot', is largely redundant as the previous step likely already revealed the key relationships and context involving both characters.\n    *   **Feedback for Prompt:** The prompt needs to strongly instruct the agent to *build upon previous findings*. It should encourage drilling down into entities and locations that have become central to the investigation (like 'Sekk' in this case) rather than making completely new, disconnected searches. Explicitly state: \"Do not repeat information already retrieved. Use the context from previous steps to guide the next.\"\n\n3.  **Ineffective Generic Searches:**\n    *   Searching for keywords like 'plot' or node types like 'Story' is a weak strategy if these exact terms are not present or are not primary identifiers in the graph. The prompt should guide the agent to infer plot elements from actions, conflicts, and significant entities rather than relying on literal keywords.\n    *   **Feedback for Prompt:** Instruct the agent",
