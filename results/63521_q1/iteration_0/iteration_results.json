  "retrieved_context": "Community 1 - Noork's Perilous Journey and Encounters:\nThis community centers around the character Noork, who is on a dangerous journey marked by conflict, evasion, and a quest for identity. Noork's past is linked to \"New York,\" and he was transported to \"Sekk's fertile valleys\" by a \"giant bird.\" He is currently traveling with \"the girl,\" with plans to take her to her \"brother's hidden village\" and subsequently to the \"city of Grath.\"\n\nNoork is a formidable survivor, having killed a \"first guard,\" \"guardian Misty One,\" and an \"other man\" during struggles, and he utilizes \"hooded cloaks\" for disguise. He has evaded or survived attacks, including one on the \"city of Bis\" by the \"warriors of the city of Konto,\" who inhabit a \"fertile valley\" and are enemies of those returning to the \"valley of Grath.\" Noork also warns about \"demons of the water.\"\n\nHis personal quest involves finding the \"giant bird\" to regain his memory and understanding of his past life in a \"jungle world.\" He has encountered a \"golden-skinned girl\" and \"young women\" who were captured. Noork is also concerned with his immediate surroundings, as evidenced by him slipping in \"cavern water,\" being in a \"chamber,\" entering a \"narrow stone-walled room\" where \"two warriors\" lay, and being hit by an \"unseen club.\" He seeks to reach the \"jungle\" and remove his current \"garment.\" The community's thematic representation lies in a protagonist's struggle for survival, self-discovery, and navigating a perilous world filled with both threats and potential allies.\n\nCommunity 2 - Von Mark's Quest for Invisibility and Earth Conquest:\nThis community centers around Doctor Von Mark, a villainous scientist who seeks the secret of invisibility to conquer Earth and make his Fatherland invincible. He operates from Sekk, a moon orbiting Luna, and is pursued by Captain Dietrich, an American who intends to live in the jungle. Doctor Von Mark mistakenly identifies others as Captain Dietrich. The key entities are Doctor Von Mark, Captain Dietrich, Earth, Fatherland, Sekk, Luna, and invisibility, highlighting a conflict between Von Mark's destructive ambitions and Captain Dietrich's pursuit, set against a backdrop of space and earthly locations. Thematic elements include scientific ambition, conquest, pursuit, and hidden identities.\n\nCommunity 3 - The Misty Ones: Island Dwellers and Mysterious Foes:\nThis community revolves around the enigmatic \"Misty Ones,\" a group associated with the \"island of Manak\" and the \"long lake of the Misty Ones.\" They are described as inhabitants of the \"mainland\" and the \"island of the unseen evil beings,\" and are also linked to the \"Temple of the Skull.\" The Misty Ones possess \"hooded faces\" and are perceived by the \"Priests of Uzdon.\" Their interactions are varied: they \"capture\" Rold, who is an \"Inhabitant Of\" Manak, and are themselves \"attacked\" by the \"Vasads.\" The Vasads also have a connection to an \"other bird\" that landed in the \"land of sunken valleys.\" The \"Temple of Uzdon\" is guarded by warriors associated with the Misty Ones. Thematically, this community portrays a supernatural or alien presence that inhabits distinct geographical locations, engages in conflict and predation, and is observed and understood by other entities.\n\nCommunity 4 - Exiles, Enslavement, and the Valley Cities:\nThis community centers around the intertwined fates of individuals and groups, often defined by conflict and subjugation. Key entities include Grath, an enemy city to Tholon Sarna; Gurn, an exile from Grath and brother to Tholon Sarna; and Sarna, who is also known as Tholon Sarna and is the daughter of Tholon Dist. Sarna is depicted as an escaping girl, and Tholon Sarna is imprisoned in the prison pit. The narrative also touches upon the Zuran people, whose enslavement is opposed, and Ud, a creature associated with the men of the jungles of Sekk. The golden men of the valley cities are noted for enslaving the men of the jungles of Sekk. The relationships highlight themes of exile (Gurn from Grath), familial ties (Tholon Sarna and Gurn as siblings, Sarna as daughter of Tholon Dist), conflict (Grath vs. Tholon Sarna), and oppression (enslavement of Zurans and men of the jungles of Sekk). The spotted narl's attack on the girl and its subsequent killing by someone (implied to be the girl or her protector) further adds to the sense of danger and struggle. Overall, this community represents a world grappling with societal structures of power, conflict between cities, and the harsh realities of enslavement and survival.\n\nCommunity 6 - Bird's Journey and Fiery Fate Above Valley:\nThis community centers around a **bird**, a **cliff**, a **fire**, and a **valley**. The narrative highlights the bird's action of carrying someone to the top of the cliff, which is situated above the valley. However, this aerial journey is dramatically interrupted as fire rises to devour the bird. Thematic elements include themes of transportation, elevation, and ultimately, destruction by natural forces.\n\nCommunity 10 - Doctor Von Mark's Cosmic Pursuit and Recovery:\nThis community centers around the enigmatic Doctor Karl Von Mark and his pursuit by Stephen Dietrich. Doctor Von Mark, driven by a mission to restore Nazidom, created crude space-ships. His activities took him from a hidden valley in Africa, where Stephen Dietrich also traveled in pursuit, to space and eventually to a \"little blob of cosmic matter\" situated beyond the Moon. Both Doctor Von Mark and Stephen Dietrich find themselves trapped on this cosmic matter. The narrative highlights a chase across continents and into space, involving rudimentary spacecraft and a peculiar cosmic location. Thematic elements include pursuit, lost memory (of Stephen Dietrich), ambitious restoration, and a perilous cosmic predicament.",

    "evaluation_feedback": "## Evaluation of the Response\n\nThe RAG system's response attempts to summarize the plot of the story but suffers from several significant issues, resulting in a low ROUGE score.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Identifies Key Characters and Locations:** The response does mention several characters (Noork, Doctor Von Mark, Captain Dietrich, Gurn, Tholon Sarna) and locations (New York, Sekk, Grath, Manak).\n*   **Attempts to Weave Threads:** It tries to connect different plot elements, albeit unsuccessfully.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Cohesion and Narrative Flow:** The biggest problem is the complete lack of a coherent narrative. The response jumps erratically between different storylines and characters without establishing connections or a clear progression. It reads like a collection of loosely related facts rather than a plot summary.\n*   **Over-reliance on Quoted Phrases:** The frequent use of quotation marks around phrases like \"New York,\" \"Sekk's fertile valleys,\" \"giant bird,\" etc., suggests the system is directly extracting snippets from the source material without synthesizing them. This leads to a stilted and unnatural summary.\n*   **Confusing and Contradictory Information:**\n    *   The description of Noork's goal is muddled. He's searching for the \"giant bird\" to regain memory, but he was *transported* by one. The connection isn't clear.\n    *   The villainous Doctor Von Mark's goals are also disjointed. He wants to conquer Earth using invisibility, but later \"Doctor Karl Von Mark\" is trying to restore Nazidom with spacecraft. Are these the same person?\n    *   The mention of \"Misty Ones\" capturing individuals and then being attacked by others feels like disconnected events.\n    *   The description of Tholon Sarna as both an \"escaping girl\" and \"imprisoned\" is contradictory.\n*   **Inclusion of Irrelevant Details:** The sentence \"A bird carrying someone to a cliff above a valley is tragically consumed by fire\" feels like a random, disconnected event that doesn't contribute to the overall plot summary.\n*   **Poor Sentence Structure and Grammar:** Some sentences are awkwardly phrased and could be clearer.\n*   **No Clear Central Conflict or Theme:** The response fails to identify or articulate the main driving force of the story or its underlying themes.\n\n**Why the ROUGE Score is Low:**\n\nROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) measures the overlap of n-grams (sequences of words) between the generated summary and a reference summary.\n\n*   **Lack of Overlap:** Because the generated response is disjointed, lacks a coherent narrative, and uses excessive quoted phrases, it is unlikely to share significant n-gram overlap with a well-written, synthesized plot summary.\n*   **Focus on Snippets, Not Meaning:** The system seems to have focused on extracting keywords and short phrases rather than understanding the relationships between plot elements and constructing a flowing narrative.\n*   **Inaccurate Representation:** The confusion and contradictions in the response mean it doesn't accurately represent the *plot* of the story, which is what the query asked for.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions\n\nTo significantly improve this response, the RAG system needs to focus on **synthesizing information and constructing a coherent narrative.** Here's how:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Information Synthesis over Extraction:**\n    *   **Identify Core Plot Threads:** The system should first try to identify the main storylines and protagonists. For example, it should recognize that Noork's journey is one central plot, and Doctor Von Mark's actions form another.\n    *   **Establish Character Motivations and Goals:** Instead of just stating what characters *do*, the system should try to infer *why* they do it. What are Noork's ultimate goals? What drives Von Mark?\n    *   **Connect Events:** Crucially, the system needs to understand the cause-and-effect relationships between plot points. How do the actions of one character affect another? How do the different storylines intersect or influence each other?\n\n2.  **Refine Character and Plot Line Descriptions:**\n    *   **Clarify Character Identities:** If \"Doctor Von Mark\" and \"Doctor Karl Von Mark\" refer to the same person, the summary should present them as such and explain their dual motivations or evolution. Similarly, the contradictory description of Tholon Sarna needs to be resolved.\n    *   **Consolidate Related Information:** Information about the \"Misty Ones,\" the \"Temple of the Skull,\" and their interactions should be presented in a more organized manner, explaining their role in the overall conflict.\n    *   **Determine the Primary Conflict:** What is the central struggle of the story? Is it Noork's quest for identity, Von Mark's conquest, or a combination? The summary should highlight this.\n\n3.  **Improve Narrative Flow and Structure:**\n    *   **Start with an Overview:** Begin with a general statement about the story's premise.\n    *   **Introduce Main Characters and Conflicts:** Present the key players and their initial situations.\n    *   **Chronological or Thematic Progression:** Structure the summary logically. This could be chronological, following the main character's journey, or thematic, grouping related plot elements.\n    *   **Use Transition Words and Phrases:** Employ words like \"meanwhile,\" \"however,\" \"consequently,\" \"furthermore,\" to link sentences and paragraphs smoothly.\n    *   **Conclude with the Overall Situation:** End by summarizing the state of affairs or the main unresolved conflicts.\n\n4.  **Eliminate Redundancy and Irrelevant Details:**\n    *   **Remove Quoted Snippets:** The system should paraphrase and integrate information naturally, avoiding the overuse of quotation marks.\n    *   **Filter Out Minor or Disconnected Events:** The \"bird consumed by fire\" sentence, if it doesn't directly impact the main plot, should be omitted.\n\n5.  **Focus on \"Plot\" - What Happens and Why:**\n    *   The query asks for the *plot*. This means explaining the sequence of events, the development of characters through these events, and the conflicts that drive the narrative forward. The current response is more of a character and setting list with some disconnected actions.\n\n**Example of a Synthesized Improvement (Illustrative, not a full rewrite):**\n\n\"The story is a sprawling adventure featuring multiple interconnected storylines. In one thread, Noork, a survivor with amnesia, is transported from what he remembers as 'New York' to the alien world of Sekk. He embarks on a perilous journey, accompanied by a young girl he intends to escort to her brother and then to the city of Grath. Noork's quest is twofold: to find the 'giant bird' that brought him there to recover his lost memories, and to navigate the dangers of this 'jungle world,' which includes confronting captured individuals, elusive 'demons of the water,' and other physical threats. He demonstrates resourcefulness, using disguises and having proven himself a survivor through combat.\n\nMeanwhile, the scientist Doctor Karl Von Mark, a figure from Sekk, harbors ambitions of conquering Earth using advanced invisibility technology, while simultaneously attempting to revive Nazidom with crude spacecraft. He is being pursued by Captain Stephen Dietrich, whose chase spans from Africa into space, leading them both to become trapped in an unknown cosmic anomaly beyond the Moon.\n\nThe narrative also touches upon the city of Grath, an enemy territory, and its exiles like Gurn. Within this world, the Zuran people face enslavement by the golden men of the valley cities, with a creature named Ud apparently linked to the enslaved men of Sekk's jungles. Additionally, the enigmatic 'Misty Ones' from Manak, who capture individuals, are themselves victims of attacks, suggesting a wider conflict involving the 'Temple of the Skull.' The fate of the escaping girl, Tholon Sarna, daughter of Tholon Dist, is unclear as she is described as both escaping and imprisoned, potentially linked to her brother Tholon Sarna.\"\n\nBy focusing on synthesis, clarity, and narrative structure, the RAG system can produce much more effective and higher-scoring responses.",

Your primary objective is to guide the selection of an appropriate `chunk_size` for graph construction, prioritizing narrative cohesion, character nuance, and causal relationships.\n\n**Current Challenge:** The default `chunk_size` of 256 tokens has been identified as suboptimal. This small size leads to:\n*   **Fragmented narratives:** Story elements are split across chunks, weakening plotline connections.\n*   **Difficulty in capturing nuance:** Character motivations and subtle shifts are dispersed, hindering deep understanding.\n*   **Obscured causal links:** The sequential and causal flow of events is weakened, making prioritization difficult.\n*   **Ambiguous entity resolution:** Insufficient context within chunks hinders differentiation and contradiction handling.\n\n**Your Task:** Based on the provided text and its narrative complexity, recommend an optimal `chunk_size`. Consider the following guidelines:\n\n1.  **Narrative Density:** Assess the complexity of the plot, character development, and interpersonal dynamics. Denser narratives with intricate relationships benefit from larger chunks to maintain contextual integrity.\n2.  **Causal and Temporal Dependencies:** Evaluate how critical sequential and causal links are to understanding the narrative. If events are highly interdependent, a larger `chunk_size` is crucial to preserve these connections within individual chunks.\n3.  **Character Arc and Motivation:** Determine if character motivations, internal monologues, and subtle emotional shifts are important. These elements require more context than smaller chunks can provide.\n4.  **Entity Specificity:** Consider the potential for entity ambiguity. If entities (characters, locations, concepts) require significant surrounding text for disambiguation, a larger `chunk_size` is beneficial.\n5.  **Computational Constraints:** While larger chunks are generally preferred for narrative depth, acknowledge potential computational limitations. Suggest a `chunk_size` that balances information richness with practical processing capabilities.\n\n**Recommended `chunk_size` Range:** Generally, consider values from 512 to 1024 tokens. However, justify your specific recommendation based on the analysis of the text's narrative characteristics.\n\n**Output Format:** Provide only the recommended `chunk_size` value (e.g., `768`) and a brief justification (<50 words) explaining how it addresses the identified narrative challenges.",

      "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The current chunk size of 256 tokens appears to be a contributing factor to the identified weaknesses in the GraphRAG system's output, particularly concerning narrative cohesion and the handling of complex plot elements.\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (256 tokens):**\n\n1.  **Fragmented Narrative Threads:** A chunk size of 256 tokens is relatively small. In narrative texts, this can lead to story elements being split across multiple chunks, even if they are closely related in the original text. This fragmentation makes it difficult for the graph extraction process to identify and connect cohesive plotlines. For example, a character's introduction, their immediate motivation, and their first action might all fall into separate chunks. When these chunks are processed into graph nodes and relationships, these connections can be weakened or lost, leading to the observed lack of narrative cohesion.\n\n2.  **Difficulty in Capturing Character Nuance and Motivation:** The critique highlights the agent's failure to handle ambiguity and prioritize causality. Smaller chunk sizes can exacerbate this. A character's full motivation or a subtle shift in their stance might be spread across several chunks. The graph extraction process, working with these smaller, isolated pieces of information, may struggle to synthesize a complete understanding of a character's arc or the underlying reasons for their actions. This results in summaries that list events rather than explaining motivations, as the graph lacks the concentrated information needed to infer these deeper connections.\n\n3.  **Weakening of Causal Relationships:** The recommendation to improve temporal and causal sequencing is directly impacted by chunk size. A cause-and-effect relationship often requires context that spans more than a few sentences. If the cause is in one 256-token chunk and the effect is in another, the direct link might be obscured during graph construction. This makes it harder for the LLM agent to prioritize plot-driving elements because the graph doesn't strongly represent the sequential and causal flow of events.\n\n4.  **Limited Context for Entity Resolution:** The critique points out issues with differentiating similar entities and handling contradictions (e.g., Tholon Sarna). A chunk size of 256 tokens might not provide enough surrounding text to clearly distinguish between different instances of an entity or to resolve conflicting information within a single chunk. This leads to ambiguity in the graph, requiring more sophisticated post-processing or leading to the agent selecting less relevant communities due to unclear entity representation.\n\n**Recommendation for Chunk Size:**\n\nConsider increasing the chunk size. A larger chunk size (e.g., 512 or 1024 tokens, depending on computational constraints and corpus characteristics) would allow for:\n\n*   **More coherent narrative segments:** Capturing more of a character's actions, dialogue, and internal thoughts within a single chunk.\n*   **Stronger representation of motivations and causal links:** Providing the graph extraction process with richer context to identify and represent these crucial plot elements.\n*   **Improved entity disambiguation:** Offering more surrounding text to differentiate entities and resolve contradictions.\n\nThis adjustment would likely lead to a more interconnected graph with clearer narrative threads, enabling the LLM agent to make more informed retrieval decisions for plot summarization.",
      "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The current prompt for graph construction has several limitations that hinder the generation of a coherent plot summary, as evidenced by the critique of the resulting graph and retrieval plan.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique and how it relates to the prompt:\n\n**1. Lack of Narrative Cohesion & Hierarchy:**\n\n*   **Prompt Issue:** The prompt focuses on identifying *all* entities and relationships without explicit guidance on prioritizing or weighting them based on narrative importance. The constraints of \"no more than 20 entities and 30 relationships\" are arbitrary and don't account for the complexity of a plot. This leads to a flat graph where tangential or minor plotlines can become as prominent as the main narrative.\n*   **Critique Reflection:** The critique highlights disparate communities and the absence of a narrative hierarchy. This is a direct consequence of the prompt not instructing the LLM to identify a central protagonist or primary conflict to guide entity and relationship extraction.\n\n**2. Ambiguity and Contradiction Handling:**\n\n*   **Prompt Issue:** The prompt asks for entities, types, properties, relationships, descriptions, and evidence. It doesn't provide a mechanism for handling conflicting information about the *same* entity across different parts of the text or different chunks. The LLM is not instructed to reconcile or flag discrepancies.\n*   **Critique Reflection:** The critique points out specific contradictions (Von Mark's motivations, Tholon Sarna's status). The prompt's structure implicitly encourages a single, unified representation for each entity, making it difficult to capture nuances or evolving states.\n\n**3. Insufficient Focus on Causality and Motivation:**\n\n*   **Prompt Issue:** While the prompt asks for relationship descriptions and evidence, it doesn't explicitly ask the LLM to infer *why* entities are related or to focus on causal links and character motivations. The emphasis is on descriptive attributes and explicit relationships.\n*   **Critique Reflection:** The critique states that summaries are descriptive lists and lack causal illumination. This suggests the prompt should push for a deeper analysis of \"why\" events happen and \"why\" characters act, rather than just \"what\" happened.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Significance:** Instruct the LLM to identify the main protagonist(s) and primary conflict(s) first. Then, guide entity and relationship extraction to prioritize elements that directly contribute to these central narrative threads. Consider a weighting system or different prompt sections for main vs. secondary plot elements.\n2.  **Introduce Discrepancy Handling:** Explicitly instruct the LLM to identify and flag conflicting information about entities. This could involve creating separate nodes for different versions/states of an entity, linked with a \"contradicts\" or \"evolves_to\" relationship, or adding a specific \"conflict_status\" property.\n3.  **Emphasize Causal and Motivational Links:** Modify the relationship extraction instructions to specifically ask for the underlying motivations, causes, and effects. For example, include a \"motivation\" field for relationships between characters and an \"effect\" field for event-related relationships.\n4.  **Refine Granularity and Specificity:** Encourage the LLM to be more specific in entity types and relationship descriptions, especially when dealing with similar entities or recurring events. Add instructions to differentiate temporal aspects of entities and relationships.",
      "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The current community selection demonstrates a clear need for more sophisticated reasoning beyond simply including all potentially relevant communities. The primary weakness lies in the failure to **prioritize and synthesize core narrative threads** when answering \"What is the plot of the story?\".\n\n**Key Issues:**\n\n1.  **Over-inclusion and Dilution of Focus:** The selection includes multiple communities (1, 2, 4, 10) with distinct protagonists (Noork, Von Mark, Sarna/Gurn) and plotlines. This broad inclusion, along with tangential elements like Community 6 (bird's fiery fate), dilutes the focus required for a cohesive plot summary. A plot typically follows a central protagonist or conflict.\n\n2.  **Failure to Resolve Ambiguities/Contradictions:** The selected communities present conflicting information without a strategy for resolution. For example, Doctor Von Mark's motivations and actions differ between Communities 2 and 10. Similarly, Tholon Sarna's status is contradictory in Community 4 (escaping vs. imprisoned). The selection should either attempt to resolve minor contradictions or strategically select communities that aid the answer LLM in doing so.\n\n3.  **Lack of Hierarchical Narrative Structure:** All selected communities are treated with equal importance. A plot summary requires understanding a primary narrative arc. The selection should identify a central protagonist/conflict and prioritize communities that directly contribute to this core thread, rather than just thematic overlap.\n\n**Recommendation for Improvement:**\n\nThe agent needs to develop a more discerning selection strategy. This includes:\n\n*   **Identifying a Primary Narrative:** Attempt to discern the most central character or conflict from the available communities.\n*   **Ranking Relevance:** Prioritize communities that directly advance this primary narrative.\n*   **Strategic Ambiguity Handling:** Develop a mechanism to either resolve simple ambiguities or select communities that, when presented together, allow the answer LLM to better resolve them. The current approach of presenting conflicting information without context is detrimental to plot summarization.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the community selection can evolve from a broad collection to a targeted set that effectively supports the generation of a coherent and focused plot summary.",
      "answer_generation_critique": "The provided feedback highlights significant shortcomings in the generated answer, primarily stemming from a lack of synthesis and narrative coherence, leading to a low ROUGE score. The current prompt is too general, asking the LLM to simply \"use the retrieved context to answer the query.\" This fails to guide the LLM towards the specific requirements of summarizing a plot.\n\n**Critique of Current Prompt and Generated Answer:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Synthesis Guidance:** The prompt doesn't instruct the LLM to connect disparate pieces of information, infer relationships, or construct a narrative. The generated answer reads like a list of extracted facts and quoted phrases, which is precisely what the feedback criticizes.\n    *   **Example:** The prompt doesn't ask the LLM to *explain* the relationships between characters or events, leading to the confusion about Doctor Von Mark/Karl Von Mark and Tholon Sarna.\n\n2.  **Failure to Prioritize Core Plot Elements:** The prompt doesn't encourage the LLM to identify the main storylines, protagonists, conflicts, or motivations. It treats all retrieved information equally, resulting in the inclusion of seemingly irrelevant details (like the bird consumed by fire) and a muddled central theme.\n    *   **Example:** The prompt doesn't instruct the LLM to identify *what* the story is about at its core, but rather to just \"answer the query.\"\n\n3.  **Over-reliance on Extraction:** The prompt's simple instruction to \"exploit the retrieved information\" can lead the LLM to directly lift phrases and sentences, as seen with the excessive use of quotation marks in the answer. This hinders natural language generation and summarization.\n    *   **Example:** The prompt does not ask for summarization or paraphrasing.\n\n4.  **Absence of Structure/Flow Instructions:** The prompt offers no guidance on how to structure the answer, such as starting with an overview, progressing logically, or using transitions. This contributes to the disjointed nature of the generated response.\n    *   **Example:** The prompt does not ask for a coherent narrative structure.\n\n**Prompt Improvement Suggestions:**\n\nTo address these issues, the prompt needs to be more directive and specific. It should explicitly guide the LLM to synthesize, prioritize, and structure the information to form a coherent plot summary.\n\n**Revised Prompt Idea:**\n\n\"You are a highly skilled storyteller tasked with summarizing a plot based on retrieved information.\nYour goal is to synthesize the provided context into a coherent and engaging plot summary of the story.\n\nThis is the query:\n{}\n\nThis is the information:\n{}\n\nInstructions:\n1.  **Identify and Synthesize Main Plot Threads:** Determine the primary storylines and characters. Connect related events and characters, even if they appear in separate snippets.\n2.  **Focus on Narrative Cohesion:** Construct a flowing narrative that explains what happens, who is involved, and their motivations/goals. Avoid simply listing facts or quoting extensively.\n3.  **Prioritize Key Information:** Exclude minor details or seemingly disconnected events that do not contribute to the main plot. Resolve contradictions if possible, or highlight them if they are central to the story's mystery.\n4.  **Structure for Clarity:** Begin with an overview, introduce key characters and conflicts, and describe the progression of events logically. Use transition words to ensure smooth flow.\n5.  **Answer only with the plot summary (no additional comment).**\"\n\nThis revised prompt explicitly asks the LLM to perform synthesis, focus on narrative, prioritize information, and structure the output, directly addressing the weaknesses identified in the feedback.",
