  "retrieved_context": "Community 1 - The Ghost Ship of Earth and Space:\nThis community centers around the enigmatic \"Ghost Ship,\" a spectral vessel interwoven with Earth's history and the vastness of space. It is described as sailing the Seven Seas throughout Earth history, yet also haunting the Solar System. The Ghost Ship is inhabited by \"Ghosts\" and serves as a home for \"space men\" who are from the Solar System but can never return. Tales of the Ghost Ship are subjects of legend, discussed by \"tellers of fairy tales,\" and even associated with drunken ramblings under the influence of \"Mars\" liquors. The narrative also touches upon related elements like a \"captain\" who uses a \"log book\" and \"phenomena\" that are not from the Solar System but are heading towards it. Thematically, this subgraph explores the intersection of folklore, historical myths, and cosmic speculation, blurring the lines between earthly lore and extraterrestrial mysteries.\n\nCommunity 8 - Space Ghost, Time, and Willard's Ordeal:\nThis community centers on the character Willard, who is a character in the story \"GALACTIC GHOST\" by WALTER KUBILIUS. The narrative employs the metaphor of \"The Flying Dutchman of space\" to describe the \"GALACTIC GHOST.\" Willard's experiences are intertwined with themes of time, loss, and survival in space. He measures time by Earth time during a vigil for a friend, communicates with the SPACE SHIP MARY LOU via a space-telegrapher, and has encountered the spectral \"Flying Dutchman\" and the departing \"Ghost Ship.\" Willard's past is represented by his associations with cities, fields, shops, and his co-workers and scientists, as well as the poignant thought of his wife whom he cannot see again. He has consumed drugged food and drink, been helped by an air-lock, and was eventually placed in bed by several men after reaching for a rope. His observations of a distant star through his space ship highlight his solitary existence in the vastness of space. Thematic elements include the enduring impact of memory, the fear of the unknown in space, and the struggle for survival against overwhelming odds.\n\nCommunity 3 - The Mary Lou's Cosmic Journey and Transformation:\nThis community centers around the exploration vessel \"Mary Lou,\" its crew, and its ultimate fate in space. Key entities include the ship itself, its captain John Willard, and a crew member, Harry Dobbin, whose atoms were transformed into pure energy and stored within the ship's motors. The Mary Lou was on a mission to explore a planetoid beyond Pluto, a destination relative to the planet Pluto itself. The ship also contained vital systems like convertors and assimilators, which produced food and air from waste, and had been spared from meteor damage. However, the Mary Lou, like all objects that \"wander alone in space,\" was subject to \"change,\" a process that gradually drained its mass and energy until it became a mere shell. This decline is reflected in its relationship with its own mass and energy. J. Willard, II, son of John Willard, is planning a successor ship, the \"Mary Lou II,\" named in memory of the original. The narrative highlights themes of space exploration, the transformative effects of the cosmos on matter and energy, and the legacy of a journey.\n\nCommunity 2 - Dying Pioneer's Last Look at the Stars:\nThis subgraph depicts the final moments of Dobbin, an aging pioneer, adrift in interstellar space. His life has been marked by a profound \"Earth-loneliness\" and his past experiences crossing \"interstellar space\" in his \"ship.\" As he faces his death, he looks out at the \"stars,\" specifically noting \"Orion's belt,\" a poignant contrast to the failing \"instruments on the control board\" of his \"old-fashioned rocket ship.\" The ship, with its \"radio\" and \"speed-recording dials,\" is a vessel that once carried pioneers but now shows no indication of other ships. Dobbin's story culminates in him joining the \"pioneers of yesterday,\" a symbolic joining with those who came before him. The narrative highlights themes of mortality, the vastness of space, and the legacy of exploration, as a solitary \"man\" observes the celestial panorama while his vessel, a testament to past journeys, falls silent.",

    "evaluation_feedback": "The ROUGE score of 0.0973 indicates that the generated response has very low overlap with a hypothetical ideal response. This suggests the response is likely missing key plot points or is too vague to be considered a good summary.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the response's strengths and weaknesses, along with specific suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Identifies Key Themes:** The response correctly identifies several overarching themes like space exploration, mysteries of the cosmos, time, loss, survival, mortality, and legacy.\n*   **Mentions Specific Elements:** It names characters (Willard, Harry Dobbin), a vessel (\"Mary Lou\"), and a central mystery (\"Ghost Ship\").\n*   **Attempts to Weave Narratives:** It tries to connect different elements like Willard's ordeals and Dobbin's transformation.\n\n**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Vagueness and Lack of Specificity:** The most significant weakness is the lack of concrete plot details. Phrases like \"experiences ordeals,\" \"atoms are transformed into energy,\" and \"facing the transformative effects of space\" are too abstract. A good plot summary needs to describe *what* happens, not just *that* things happen.\n\n    *   **Improvement:** Instead of saying Willard \"experiences ordeals involving time, loss, and survival,\" the response should explain *what* these ordeals are. For example, \"Willard is stranded on a derelict ship, battling the effects of temporal distortion and desperately trying to survive.\" Similarly, \"atoms are transformed into energy\" should be explained as part of a specific event or phenomenon.\n\n2.  **Unclear Chronology and Interconnectedness:** While the response mentions \"intertwined narratives,\" it doesn't clearly explain *how* they are intertwined or in what order events occur. The \"Ghost Ship\" traversing \"Earth's history and the Solar System\" is a compelling concept, but the response doesn't detail its role in the plot beyond existing.\n\n    *   **Improvement:** The summary needs to establish a clearer narrative flow. Is the \"Ghost Ship\" a recurring element across different timelines? Does it directly impact Willard or Dobbin's stories? Explaining the connection between the \"Ghost Ship,\" Willard's journey, and Dobbin's fate would greatly improve coherence.\n\n3.  **Lack of a Clear Central Conflict or Goal:** The response describes elements of the story but doesn't articulate a central conflict or what the characters are trying to achieve. Is there a specific mission for the \"Mary Lou\"? What is Willard trying to accomplish? What is the significance of Dobbin's final moments?\n\n    *   **Improvement:** A strong plot summary outlines the main conflict or the driving force of the narrative. For instance, \"The crew of the 'Mary Lou' is on a mission to investigate the mysterious 'Ghost Ship,' an anomaly that appears to be warping time and space. They must uncover its origins before it consumes them.\"\n\n4.  **Over-reliance on Thematic Statements:** While themes are important, they should arise organically from the plot. The response leans heavily on stating themes (\"Themes of memory, the unknown, survival, mortality...\") rather than demonstrating them through plot events.\n\n    *   **Improvement:** Integrate themes into the plot description. Instead of saying \"themes of mortality are interwoven,\" describe a scene where a character faces their mortality due to a specific plot event.\n\n5.  **Missed Opportunities for Specific Plot Details:** The \"Ghost Ship\" is a fascinating element. The response could elaborate on its nature, its effects, or its history within the story. Similarly, Dobbin's \"final moments\" could be described more vividly.\n\n    *   **Improvement:** Add details like: \"The 'Ghost Ship' is revealed to be a derelict vessel from humanity's past, now a sentient entity that lures explorers into its temporal embrace.\" Or, \"Adrift, Dobbin reflects on his pioneering days and the sacrifices made for humanity's expansion into the stars, as his own life force fades into the cosmic void.\"\n\n**Example of an Improved Response (Hypothetical):**\n\n\"The story revolves around the enigmatic 'Ghost Ship,' a spectral vessel that appears across different epochs of Earth's history and journeys through the Solar System. The narrative follows two intertwined storylines: Willard, a survivor facing harrowing temporal distortions and personal loss while aboard a derelict spaceship, and Harry Dobbin, an aging pioneer whose atoms are undergoing a mysterious energetic transformation as he drifts alone in space. The exploration ship 'Mary Lou' embarks on a perilous voyage beyond Pluto, seeking to understand and possibly confront the 'Ghost Ship' and its destabilizing effects on reality. As Willard battles for survival and Dobbin contemplates his life and mortality in the vastness of space, the crew of the 'Mary Lou' uncovers the 'Ghost Ship's' origins, revealing it as a relic of a forgotten era that now poses a profound threat to the continuity of time and existence.\"\n\n**In summary, to improve the response and achieve a higher ROUGE score, the RAG system needs to:**\n\n*   **Extract and synthesize more specific plot points.**\n*   **Clarify the causal relationships and chronology between events and characters.**\n*   **Articulate the central conflict and character motivations.**\n*   **Demonstrate themes through plot actions rather than just stating them.**\n*   **Provide a more concrete and narrative-driven summary of \"what happens\" in the story.**",

Your task is to determine the most effective hyperparameters for graph construction, specifically focusing on `chunk_size`.\n\nThe current strategy has shown limitations in capturing narrative coherence, plot progression, and character journeys, potentially due to an insufficient `chunk_size`. A `chunk_size` that is too small can:\n\n*   **Fragment Events:** Split descriptions of crucial plot points or character transformations across multiple chunks, preventing their complete understanding and accurate node representation.\n*   **Obscure Relationships:** Limit the discovery of explicit temporal and causal links by only capturing immediate co-occurrences within short segments, rather than broader cause-and-effect.\n*   **Atomize Narrative Arcs:** Break down continuous story progression into isolated pieces, leading to communities that represent minor thematic similarities but fail to capture overarching plot stages.\n*   **Hinder Character Understanding:** Prevent the capturing of evolving character motivations, conflicts, and development over longer narrative sequences.\n\n**Your Objective:** Recommend an optimal `chunk_size` (and potentially a range for experimentation) that addresses these limitations.\n\n**Consider the following when making your recommendation:**\n\n1.  **Narrative Completeness:** The `chunk_size` must be large enough to contain the contextual information necessary for a single, meaningful event, character interaction, or plot development to be extracted holistically. Aim for chunk sizes that are likely to encompass full sentences, paragraphs, or logical narrative segments.\n2.  **Relationship Discovery:** A larger `chunk_size` facilitates the identification of more robust temporal, causal, and thematic relationships between entities and events. Prioritize a size that increases the likelihood of capturing these links.\n3.  **Graph Coherence:** The goal is to construct a graph that reflects the narrative's structure and flow. The `chunk_size` should support the formation of nodes and communities that represent coherent plot points and character arcs, not isolated fragments.\n4.  **Scalability vs. Depth:** While larger chunks offer more context, consider the trade-off with graph size and computational complexity. However, for narrative-heavy content, prioritizing depth of understanding and coherence is paramount.\n\n**Provide a specific `chunk_size` recommendation and justify it based on the need to improve narrative coherence, plot representation, temporal/causal linking, and character journey capture.** If a range is more appropriate for initial experimentation, provide that along with a primary recommendation.",

      "learned_prompt_graph_builder": "You are a highly advanced AI tasked with constructing a knowledge graph from narrative text for a GraphRAG system. Your primary objective is to build a graph that can answer plot-centric queries by accurately capturing events, their temporal sequencing, causal dependencies, and their significance to the narrative.\n\n**Instructions for Graph Construction:**\n\n1.  **Identify Core Entities:** Extract significant entities (characters, locations, objects, concepts). For each entity, identify its `name`, `type` (e.g., `Person`, `Location`, `Object`, `Concept`), and a concise `description`.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Events:** Extract significant events as first-class nodes. An event is an action or occurrence that advances the plot. For each event, identify its `name` (a descriptive phrase, e.g., \"Willard's Ordeal\", \"Mary Lou's Mission\"), `type` (e.g., `Event`, `Action`, `Conflict`, `Resolution`), and a brief `description`.\n\n3.  **Define Relationships:** Establish relationships between entities and between entities and events.\n    *   **Relationship Structure:** Each relationship must have a `source` node, a `target` node, a `type`, and a `description`.\n    *   **Relationship Types:** Use specific and descriptive types. Prioritize:\n        *   **Temporal:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`, `simultaneous_with`\n        *   **Causal:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `prevents`\n        *   **Interaction/Association:** `interacts_with`, `possesses`, `located_in`, `part_of`, `related_to`\n    *   **Relationship Description:** Briefly explain the nature of the connection, especially highlighting its role in the narrative flow.\n\n4.  **Indicate Plot Significance:** For entities and events, infer and assign a `plot_significance` attribute. Possible values include:\n    *   `protagonist`, `antagonist`, `supporting_character`\n    *   `inciting_incident`, `rising_action`, `climax`, `falling_action`, `resolution`\n    *   `setting_element`\n    *   `lore` (for background information not directly driving the plot)\n\n5.  **Differentiate Lore from Action:** When defining entities and relationships, explicitly distinguish between background lore (e.g., a character's backstory, world-building details) and plot-driving actions or events. Use the `plot_significance` attribute and descriptive relationship types to make this distinction clear.\n\n6.  **Maintain Narrative Cohesion:** Ensure that relationships accurately reflect the chronological and causal flow of the story. Avoid creating disconnected subgraphs where plot progression is obscured.\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the constructed graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either an entity node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Example:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id_1\", \"type\": \"Person\", \"name\": \"Willard\", \"description\": \"A key character.\", \"plot_significance\": \"protagonist\"}`\n*   **Event Example:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id_2\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"Willard's Ordeal\", \"description\": \"The challenging period Willard faced.\", \"plot_significance\": \"rising_action\"}`\n*   **Relationship Example:** `{\"source\": \"unique_id_1\", \"target\": \"unique_id_2\", \"type\": \"experiences\", \"description\": \"Willard directly underwent this ordeal.\"}`\n*   **Temporal Relationship Example:** `{\"source\": \"event_A_id\", \"target\": \"event_B_id\", \"type\": \"precedes\", \"description\": \"Event A happened before Event B.\"}`\n*   **Causal Relationship Example:** `{\"source\": \"event_C_id\", \"target\": \"event_D_id\", \"type\": \"causes\", \"description\": \"Event C directly led to Event D.\"}`",
      "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 150 appears to be a contributing factor to the limitations observed in the graph, particularly concerning narrative coherence and plot representation.\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (150):**\n\n1.  **Insufficient Context for Events:** A chunk size of 150, while moderate, may not be large enough to capture the full context of individual plot-driving events. For instance, the transformation of Harry Dobbin's atoms is an event that likely spans across sentences and paragraphs. If this event's description is split across multiple chunks, the graph extraction process might struggle to associate all the relevant details with a single event node or accurately represent its causal links. This fragmentation makes it difficult to reconstruct the \"what happens\" aspect of the plot.\n\n2.  **Limited Temporal and Causal Relationship Discovery:** The primary critique highlights the lack of explicit temporal and causal links. Smaller chunks inherently contain less sequential information. When relationships are extracted within these smaller segments, they are more likely to represent immediate co-occurrences rather than broader narrative cause-and-effect. For example, a 150-token chunk might describe a character's immediate reaction, but not the preceding event that caused it or the subsequent consequence. This hinders the ability to build a chronological or causal narrative flow.\n\n3.  **Atomization of Narrative Arcs:** The critique points to a \"fragmented narrative arc.\" Smaller chunk sizes can exacerbate this by breaking down what should be a continuous narrative sequence into isolated pieces. Communities formed from these fragmented chunks may represent thematic similarities within a small segment but fail to capture the overarching story progression. This atomization makes it harder for the LLM agent to select communities that represent distinct stages of the plot.\n\n4.  **Difficulty in Capturing Character Journeys:** Character development and journeys are often described over longer passages. A 150-token chunk might only capture a snapshot of a character's state or a single interaction. This makes it challenging to identify motivation, conflict progression, or the evolution of a character's role within the story, leading to the observed \"ambiguous character roles.\"\n\n**Recommendations for Chunk Size Improvement:**\n\n*   **Increase Chunk Size for Narrative Capture:** Experiment with larger chunk sizes (e.g., 300-500 tokens). This would provide more context within each chunk, allowing for the extraction of more complete event descriptions, clearer causal links, and a better representation of character arcs and narrative progression.\n*   **Dynamic Chunking (if feasible):** While fixed chunk sizes are simpler, consider if a dynamic approach that respects sentence and paragraph boundaries could be more beneficial for narrative content, preventing the arbitrary splitting of key plot points.",
      "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The current prompt for graph construction is too focused on static entity-relationship extraction and lacks the necessary guidance to build a graph that can effectively answer plot-centric queries.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n**1. Insufficient Emphasis on Events and Narrative Flow:**\n*   **Critique:** The prompt asks for \"entities\" and \"relationships\" but doesn't explicitly define or encourage the extraction of *events* as first-class nodes. The plot of a story is fundamentally a sequence of events. The current structure likely results in a graph of static facts rather than a dynamic narrative.\n*   **Impact:** This leads to fragmented understanding, as seen in the critique where the graph can't establish chronological or causal links between key plot points. For example, \"Willard's ordeal\" and \"Mary Lou's mission\" might be captured as separate communities, but their connection in time or cause-and-effect is lost.\n\n**2. Lack of Temporal and Causal Relationship Specification:**\n*   **Critique:** The prompt asks for relationship \"types\" and \"descriptions\" but doesn't guide the LLM to identify and explicitly label temporal (e.g., \"precedes,\" \"follows,\" \"occurs during\") or causal (e.g., \"causes,\" \"results in\") relationships between entities or events.\n*   **Impact:** Without these explicit links, the LLM agent cannot reconstruct the sequence of actions or understand how one part of the story leads to another. The narrative arc is broken because the underlying structure doesn't encode temporal or causal dependencies.\n\n**3. Undefined \"Plot Drivers\" vs. \"Lore\":**\n*   **Critique:** The prompt treats all entities and relationships equally, failing to differentiate between background information (lore) and elements that actively drive the plot forward (inciting incidents, conflicts, resolutions).\n*   **Impact:** This makes it difficult for the retrieval agent to prioritize relevant information for a plot query. It cannot distinguish between a character's historical background and their actions that propel the story.\n\n**4. Entity Granularity Over Event Granularity:**\n*   **Critique:** The prompt is geared towards identifying objects (entities) and their attributes/connections. It doesn't prompt for the identification of *actions* or *occurrences* that constitute the plot itself.\n*   **Impact:** While entities are important, the plot is about what happens to these entities. The current prompt prioritizes the \"what is\" over the \"what happens.\"\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n*   **Introduce Event Nodes:** Modify the prompt to explicitly instruct the LLM to identify and represent key events as distinct nodes (e.g., `type: Event`, `name: \"Mary Lou's Transformation\"`).\n*   **Mandate Temporal/Causal Relationships:** Add instructions to define relationships not just by description but by specific temporal (e.g., `type: precedes`) or causal (e.g., `type: causes`) labels.\n*   **Prompt for Plot Significance:** Ask the LLM to infer and label entities or events based on their role in the plot (e.g., `role: protagonist`, `plot_marker: inciting_incident`).\n*   **Differentiate Lore from Action:** Encourage the LLM to distinguish between descriptive background information and plot-driving actions within the relationship descriptions or by adding specific relationship types.\n\nBy incorporating these changes, the prompt will guide the LLM to construct a knowledge graph that better captures the sequential and causal nature of a narrative, thereby improving its suitability for plot-centric queries.",
      "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "## Critique of Community Selection for \"What is the plot of the story?\"\n\nThe current community selection prompt and resulting retrieval, while identifying relevant thematic areas, fall short in constructing a coherent narrative for answering \"What is the plot of the story?\".\n\n**Key Issues:**\n\n*   **Lack of Narrative Flow:** The selected communities (1, 8, 3, 2) provide pieces of the story but do not inherently convey a sequential or causal progression. Community 1 introduces a mythical element, while Community 2 presents a potentially final scene. Without a clear indication of *how* these elements connect temporally, the selection fails to build a narrative. The prompt needs to guide the agent to prioritize summaries that describe events and their consequences.\n*   **Thematic Over Emphasis:** The agent has prioritized thematic resonance (e.g., \"folklore, cosmic speculation,\" \"time, loss, survival\") over plot progression. While thematic richness is valuable, the query specifically requests the \"plot,\" which necessitates an understanding of *what happens* in sequence. The agent should be instructed to look for summaries detailing character actions, conflicts, and resolutions, not just abstract themes.\n*   **Insufficient Prioritization of Core Plot Elements:** Communities 8 (Willard's ordeal) and 3 (Mary Lou's journey) likely contain more central plot information than the more atmospheric Community 1 and the potentially concluding Community 2. The selection process needs a mechanism to weigh communities that describe the main conflict and protagonist's journey more heavily for plot-related queries.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Explicitly Instruct for Sequential Relevance:** Modify the prompt to state: \"When selecting communities for a 'plot' query, prioritize those that describe a sequence of events, cause-and-effect relationships, and character actions. Consider how communities might chronologically contribute to a story's progression.\"\n2.  **Guide Prioritization of Narrative Drivers:** Add: \"Focus on communities that detail the main conflict, protagonist's journey, and key plot developments over those that focus solely on thematic backgrounds or isolated scenes, unless those scenes are crucial plot points.\"\n3.  **Reinforce \"What Happens\" over \"What It Means\":** Include: \"For plot-related queries, favor summaries that clearly articulate 'what happens' in the story, rather than those that primarily offer thematic interpretations or symbolic meanings.\"",

These issues stem directly from the prompt's limitations.\n\n**Key Issues and Prompt Improvement Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Plot-Specific Instructions:** The prompt doesn't guide the LLM to identify or synthesize plot elements.
