  "retrieved_context": "Community 1 - The Ghost Ship of Earth and Space:\nThis community centers around the enigmatic \"Ghost Ship,\" a spectral vessel interwoven with Earth's history and the vastness of space. It is described as sailing the Seven Seas throughout Earth history, yet also haunting the Solar System. The Ghost Ship is inhabited by \"Ghosts\" and serves as a home for \"space men\" who are from the Solar System but can never return. Tales of the Ghost Ship are subjects of legend, discussed by \"tellers of fairy tales,\" and even associated with drunken ramblings under the influence of \"Mars\" liquors. The narrative also touches upon related elements like a \"captain\" who uses a \"log book\" and \"phenomena\" that are not from the Solar System but are heading towards it. Thematically, this subgraph explores the intersection of folklore, historical myths, and cosmic speculation, blurring the lines between earthly lore and extraterrestrial mysteries.\n\nCommunity 3 - The Mary Lou's Cosmic Journey and Transformation:\nThis community centers around the exploration vessel \"Mary Lou,\" its crew, and its ultimate fate in space. Key entities include the ship itself, its captain John Willard, and a crew member, Harry Dobbin, whose atoms were transformed into pure energy and stored within the ship's motors. The Mary Lou was on a mission to explore a planetoid beyond Pluto, a destination relative to the planet Pluto itself. The ship also contained vital systems like convertors and assimilators, which produced food and air from waste, and had been spared from meteor damage. However, the Mary Lou, like all objects that \"wander alone in space,\" was subject to \"change,\" a process that gradually drained its mass and energy until it became a mere shell. This decline is reflected in its relationship with its own mass and energy. J. Willard, II, son of John Willard, is planning a successor ship, the \"Mary Lou II,\" named in memory of the original. The narrative highlights themes of space exploration, the transformative effects of the cosmos on matter and energy, and the legacy of a journey.\n\nCommunity 8 - Space Ghost, Time, and Willard's Ordeal:\nThis community centers on the character Willard, who is a character in the story \"GALACTIC GHOST\" by WALTER KUBILIUS. The narrative employs the metaphor of \"The Flying Dutchman of space\" to describe the \"GALACTIC GHOST.\" Willard's experiences are intertwined with themes of time, loss, and survival in space. He measures time by Earth time during a vigil for a friend, communicates with the SPACE SHIP MARY LOU via a space-telegrapher, and has encountered the spectral \"Flying Dutchman\" and the departing \"Ghost Ship.\" Willard's past is represented by his associations with cities, fields, shops, and his co-workers and scientists, as well as the poignant thought of his wife whom he cannot see again. He has consumed drugged food and drink, been helped by an air-lock, and was eventually placed in bed by several men after reaching for a rope. His observations of a distant star through his space ship highlight his solitary existence in the vastness of space. Thematic elements include the enduring impact of memory, the fear of the unknown in space, and the struggle for survival against overwhelming odds.",

    "evaluation_feedback": "The ROUGE score of 0.1298 is quite low, indicating that the generated response shares very little overlap with what would be considered an ideal summary of the plot. Let's break down why this might be the case and how to improve it.\n\n**Evaluation of the Current Response:**\n\nThe current response attempts to synthesize information about two main elements: the \"Ghost Ship\" and the \"Mary Lou.\" It also weaves in elements of a character named Willard and his experiences.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Identifies Key Entities:** It correctly identifies the \"Ghost Ship\" and the \"Mary Lou\" as central to the story.\n*   **Introduces Character:** It mentions John Willard and his successor, linking them to the \"Mary Lou.\"\n*   **Hints at Themes:** It touches upon themes like space exploration, transformation, memory, and survival.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Cohesion/Narrative Flow:** The response feels like a collection of facts and descriptions rather than a coherent plot summary. It jumps between the \"Ghost Ship,\" the \"Mary Lou,\" and Willard's personal experiences without clearly establishing how they connect *within the narrative's plot*.\n*   **Confusing \"Plot\" Definition:** The response seems to describe elements *of* the story rather than the actual sequence of events or the overarching narrative arc. For example, \"The 'Ghost Ship,' a legendary spectral vessel, sails both Earth's seas and haunts the Solar System...\" describes what it is, not what it *does* in the plot.\n*   **Over-reliance on Descriptions:** Much of the response is descriptive (\"equipped with advanced systems,\" \"subject to cosmic transformation,\" \"experiences an ordeal\") rather than action-oriented. A plot summary should focus on what happens.\n*   **Unclear Connections:**\n    *   How does the \"Ghost Ship\" interact with the \"Mary Lou\"? The response mentions they are both present and there are encounters, but doesn't explain the *plot significance* of these encounters.\n    *   Who is Willard, and how does his \"ordeal\" drive the plot of *this specific story*? Is he the captain of the \"Mary Lou\"? Is he associated with the \"Ghost Ship\"? The response is ambiguous.\n    *   The mention of \"GALACTIC GHOST\" by WALTER KUBILIUS is a significant detail that might explain the confusion but isn't integrated well into the plot summary of *this* story. Is this an excerpt from that work, or is it a story that *features* elements from it? The response doesn't clarify the relationship.\n*   **Inclusion of Minor Details:** Details like \"survived meteor damage,\" \"food and air production from waste,\" and specific actions like \"consuming drugged food and drink\" or \"being helped into bed\" are too granular for a high-level plot summary unless they are crucial turning points in the narrative.\n*   **Vague Language:** Phrases like \"intertwined fates,\" \"associated with its captain,\" and \"phenomena originating from beyond the Solar System\" are descriptive but don't explain the actual plot events.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\nTo significantly improve the response, the RAG system needs to focus on extracting and synthesizing the *sequence of events* that constitute the story's plot.\n\n1.  **Prioritize Sequential Events:** The system should identify the beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution of the story. The response needs to answer: \"What happens, in order?\"\n\n2.  **Clarify Character Roles and Motivations:**\n    *   Who is the protagonist? Is it the crew of the \"Mary Lou,\" Willard, or someone else?\n    *   What is the central conflict or goal?\n    *   How do the \"Ghost Ship\" and the \"Mary Lou\" intersect in a way that drives the plot forward? Do they collide? Does one rescue the other? Does the \"Ghost Ship\" impede the \"Mary Lou's\" mission?\n\n3.  **Establish Clear Connections:**\n    *   Explicitly state how the \"Ghost Ship\" and the \"Mary Lou\" relate within the narrative. For instance, \"The mission of the 'Mary Lou' is jeopardized when it encounters the spectral 'Ghost Ship'...\"\n    *   Clarify Willard's role. If he's the captain of the \"Mary Lou,\" the response should reflect that. If his \"ordeal\" is a separate but thematically linked storyline, the summary should explain how it connects to the primary narrative.\n    *   Address the \"GALACTIC GHOST\" reference. Is this story *about* Willard from that book? If so, the summary should frame it that way. If it's a story where elements are *borrowed*, explain that.\n\n4.  **Focus on Plot Drivers, Not Just Descriptions:**\n    *   Instead of saying the \"Mary Lou\" is \"equipped with advanced systems,\" focus on what these systems *enable* or *fail to do* at a critical moment.\n    *   Instead of saying Willard \"experiences an ordeal,\" describe *what* the ordeal is and how it impacts the plot. For example, \"Willard faces a severe crisis when...\"\n\n5.  **Condense and Generalize:** Remove granular details that don't directly contribute to understanding the main plot points. Combine similar ideas into more concise statements.\n\n6.  **Structure as a Narrative:** Start with the setup, introduce the conflict, describe the unfolding events, and hint at or state the resolution.\n\n**Example of an Improved Approach (Hypothetical):**\n\nLet's imagine the story is about the \"Mary Lou\" encountering the \"Ghost Ship\" and Willard being a key figure in that encounter. A better plot summary might look like this:\n\n\"The story centers on the exploration vessel 'Mary Lou,' captained by John Willard, as it embarks on a mission to explore a planetoid beyond Pluto. During their journey, the 'Mary Lou' encounters the legendary 'Ghost Ship,' a spectral vessel rumored to roam space. The presence of the 'Ghost Ship' introduces a supernatural and terrifying element to the mission, mirroring the plight of Willard, who is described as the 'Flying Dutchman of space' due to his own solitary and transformative existence. The narrative explores the psychological toll of deep space travel and the mystery surrounding these spectral ships, focusing on how Willard and the crew of the 'Mary Lou' cope with their encounters and the vast, transforming emptiness of the cosmos. The story highlights the endurance of memory and the fear of the unknown as Willard grapples with his past life and present isolation amidst these cosmic phenomena.\"\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe RAG system needs to shift from describing elements *of* the story to narrating the *sequence of events* that make up the plot. This requires a stronger emphasis on cause-and-effect, character actions, conflict, and resolution, while filtering out descriptive details and clarifying ambiguous connections.",

      "learned_prompt_graph_builder": "You are a highly advanced AI tasked with constructing a knowledge graph from narrative text for a GraphRAG system. Your primary objective is to build a graph that can answer plot-centric queries by accurately capturing events, their temporal sequencing, causal dependencies, and their significance to the narrative.\n\n**Instructions for Graph Construction:**\n\n1.  **Identify Core Entities:** Extract significant entities (characters, locations, objects, concepts). For each entity, identify its `name`, `type` (e.g., `Person`, `Location`, `Object`, `Concept`), and a concise `description`.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Events:** Extract significant events as first-class nodes. An event is an action or occurrence that advances the plot. For each event, identify its `name` (a descriptive phrase, e.g., \"Willard's Ordeal\", \"Mary Lou's Mission\"), `type` (e.g., `Event`, `Action`, `Conflict`, `Resolution`), and a brief `description`.\n\n3.  **Define Relationships:** Establish relationships between entities and between entities and events.\n    *   **Relationship Structure:** Each relationship must have a `source` node, a `target` node, a `type`, and a `description`.\n    *   **Relationship Types:** Use specific and descriptive types. Prioritize:\n        *   **Temporal:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`, `simultaneous_with`\n        *   **Causal:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `prevents`\n        *   **Interaction/Association:** `interacts_with`, `possesses`, `located_in`, `part_of`, `related_to`\n    *   **Relationship Description:** Briefly explain the nature of the connection, especially highlighting its role in the narrative flow.\n\n4.  **Indicate Plot Significance:** For entities and events, infer and assign a `plot_significance` attribute. Possible values include:\n    *   `protagonist`, `antagonist`, `supporting_character`\n    *   `inciting_incident`, `rising_action`, `climax`, `falling_action`, `resolution`\n    *   `setting_element`\n    *   `lore` (for background information not directly driving the plot)\n\n5.  **Differentiate Lore from Action:** When defining entities and relationships, explicitly distinguish between background lore (e.g., a character's backstory, world-building details) and plot-driving actions or events. Use the `plot_significance` attribute and descriptive relationship types to make this distinction clear.\n\n6.  **Maintain Narrative Cohesion:** Ensure that relationships accurately reflect the chronological and causal flow of the story. Avoid creating disconnected subgraphs where plot progression is obscured.\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the constructed graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either an entity node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Example:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id_1\", \"type\": \"Person\", \"name\": \"Willard\", \"description\": \"A key character.\", \"plot_significance\": \"protagonist\"}`\n*   **Event Example:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id_2\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"Willard's Ordeal\", \"description\": \"The challenging period Willard faced.\", \"plot_significance\": \"rising_action\"}`\n*   **Relationship Example:** `{\"source\": \"unique_id_1\", \"target\": \"unique_id_2\", \"type\": \"experiences\", \"description\": \"Willard directly underwent this ordeal.\"}`\n*   **Temporal Relationship Example:** `{\"source\": \"event_A_id\", \"target\": \"event_B_id\", \"type\": \"precedes\", \"description\": \"Event A happened before Event B.\"}`\n*   **Causal Relationship Example:** `{\"source\": \"event_C_id\", \"target\": \"event_D_id\", \"type\": \"causes\", \"description\": \"Event C directly led to Event D.\"}`",
      "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The current chunk size of 200 tokens appears to be **too small** and is likely contributing to several issues identified in the graph's critique. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **Fragmented Narrative and Causal Links:** A chunk size of 200 tokens is quite limited. For narrative texts, key plot points, character interactions, and causal relationships often span across larger segments of text. Small chunks are likely breaking these connections. For example, an event and its immediate consequence might be split into two separate chunks, preventing the graph extraction from identifying a `CAUSES` or `PRECEDES` relationship. This directly explains the critique's point about \"Weak Relationship Representation for Plot\" and the lack of temporal/causal depth.\n\n2.  **Over-representation of Descriptive Entities and \"Unknown\" Types:** Small chunks might contain isolated descriptive phrases or single entities without sufficient context. This can lead to the entity recognition system struggling to assign a meaningful type, thus inflating the \"Unknown\" category. Without enough surrounding text to establish the entity's role or function within a larger narrative context, it's hard to classify it as a \"Person,\" \"Event,\" or specific \"Concept.\" This aligns with the critique's first point about \"Over-representation of Descriptive Entities.\"\n\n3.  **Disrupted Community Coherence:** Communities are formed by merging nodes that are related. If chunks are too small, entities that are narratively linked but appear in adjacent or slightly separated small chunks might not be co-extracted within the *same* chunk often enough to form strong links. This can lead to weaker community structures and a failure to group narrative elements that belong together, contributing to the critique's point about \"Lack of Narrative Structure in Communities.\"\n\n4.  **Difficulty in Identifying Plot-Driving Events:** Larger narrative events, like a specific encounter or a turning point, might be spread across multiple small chunks. This fragmentation makes it harder for the extraction process to recognize these as cohesive `Event` entities with defined actions and outcomes.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nIncrease the chunk size. Experiment with larger sizes (e.g., 500-1000 tokens) to allow for more contextual information within each chunk. This will facilitate the extraction of more coherent narrative arcs, stronger causal and temporal relationships, and better entity typing, addressing the core limitations highlighted in the graph critique.",
      "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The current prompt for graph construction is too focused on static entity-relationship extraction and lacks the necessary guidance to build a graph that can effectively answer plot-centric queries.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n**1. Insufficient Emphasis on Events and Narrative Flow:**\n*   **Critique:** The prompt asks for \"entities\" and \"relationships\" but doesn't explicitly define or encourage the extraction of *events* as first-class nodes. The plot of a story is fundamentally a sequence of events. The current structure likely results in a graph of static facts rather than a dynamic narrative.\n*   **Impact:** This leads to fragmented understanding, as seen in the critique where the graph can't establish chronological or causal links between key plot points. For example, \"Willard's ordeal\" and \"Mary Lou's mission\" might be captured as separate communities, but their connection in time or cause-and-effect is lost.\n\n**2. Lack of Temporal and Causal Relationship Specification:**\n*   **Critique:** The prompt asks for relationship \"types\" and \"descriptions\" but doesn't guide the LLM to identify and explicitly label temporal (e.g., \"precedes,\" \"follows,\" \"occurs during\") or causal (e.g., \"causes,\" \"results in\") relationships between entities or events.\n*   **Impact:** Without these explicit links, the LLM agent cannot reconstruct the sequence of actions or understand how one part of the story leads to another. The narrative arc is broken because the underlying structure doesn't encode temporal or causal dependencies.\n\n**3. Undefined \"Plot Drivers\" vs. \"Lore\":**\n*   **Critique:** The prompt treats all entities and relationships equally, failing to differentiate between background information (lore) and elements that actively drive the plot forward (inciting incidents, conflicts, resolutions).\n*   **Impact:** This makes it difficult for the retrieval agent to prioritize relevant information for a plot query. It cannot distinguish between a character's historical background and their actions that propel the story.\n\n**4. Entity Granularity Over Event Granularity:**\n*   **Critique:** The prompt is geared towards identifying objects (entities) and their attributes/connections. It doesn't prompt for the identification of *actions* or *occurrences* that constitute the plot itself.\n*   **Impact:** While entities are important, the plot is about what happens to these entities. The current prompt prioritizes the \"what is\" over the \"what happens.\"\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n*   **Introduce Event Nodes:** Modify the prompt to explicitly instruct the LLM to identify and represent key events as distinct nodes (e.g., `type: Event`, `name: \"Mary Lou's Transformation\"`).\n*   **Mandate Temporal/Causal Relationships:** Add instructions to define relationships not just by description but by specific temporal (e.g., `type: precedes`) or causal (e.g., `type: causes`) labels.\n*   **Prompt for Plot Significance:** Ask the LLM to infer and label entities or events based on their role in the plot (e.g., `role: protagonist`, `plot_marker: inciting_incident`).\n*   **Differentiate Lore from Action:** Encourage the LLM to distinguish between descriptive background information and plot-driving actions within the relationship descriptions or by adding specific relationship types.\n\nBy incorporating these changes, the prompt will guide the LLM to construct a knowledge graph that better captures the sequential and causal nature of a narrative, thereby improving its suitability for plot-centric queries.",
      "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "**Critique of Community Selection for \"Plot\" Query:**\n\nThe current selection of Communities 1, 3, and 8, while containing related entities, has missed the mark for answering \"What is the plot of the story?\". The core issue is that the summaries provided are **descriptive overviews of concepts and entities rather than a coherent, sequential narrative of events.**\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Flow and Chronology:** The summaries detail *what* things are (Ghost Ship, Mary Lou's mission, Willard's ordeal) but don't establish the *order* in which events occur or how they connect causally. A plot is fundamentally about the sequence of events. The current selection fails to present a clear \"beginning, middle, and end\" or show how one event leads to another.\n\n2.  **Focus on Description Over Action:** The summaries are rich in thematic elements and descriptive attributes (e.g., \"spectral vessel,\" \"atoms transformed,\" \"drugged food\"). While informative for understanding the setting or mood, these are not plot points. A plot requires an emphasis on *actions* taken by characters and the *events* that unfold as a result. The summaries describe states and characteristics more than dynamic occurrences.\n\n3.  **Weak Causal Links and Consequences:** While there are mentions of interactions (e.g., Willard's encounter with the Ghost Ship), the summaries do not elaborate on the *impact* of these interactions or how they drive the story forward. For a plot, it's crucial to understand the cause-and-effect relationships between events and their consequences for characters and the narrative.\n\n4.  **Ambiguous Central Narrative:** Community 8 mentions \"GALACTIC GHOST\" and Walter Kubilius, introducing a potential primary story but also intertwining it with other elements. The selection doesn't clearly identify which narrative thread is the main plot and how the chosen communities contribute to it cohesively.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Sequential Events:** The agent should be trained to identify summaries that explicitly describe a sequence of actions, conflicts, resolutions, or character arcs. Look for indicators of temporal progression.\n*   **Identify Action and Causality:** Favor communities that detail character actions, event progression, and the cause-and-effect relationships that drive the story.\n*   **Filter for Narrative Drivers:** De-emphasize purely descriptive or thematic summaries and prioritize those that outline conflicts, challenges, character journeys, and the unfolding of a story's central conflict. The goal is to find the *story*, not just its components.",
      "answer_generation_critique": "Critique of the Previous Answer Generation Prompt:\n\nThe previous prompt was overly broad and did not sufficiently guide the LLM towards generating a *plot summary* specifically. While it asked for \"key narrative components,\" it allowed for a descriptive output that lacked chronological flow and clear causal relationships, as evidenced by the generated answer.\n\n**Specific Issues and Prompt Improvement Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Ambiguity in \"Synthesize Plot Elements\":** The prompt asked for \"Main Characters,\" \"Setting,\" \"Central Conflict/Problem,\" and \"Key Events.\" However, the output focused more on *describing* these elements rather than narrating *how they interact and unfold* sequentially.\n\n    *   **Improvement:** Explicitly instruct the LLM to focus on the *sequence of events*. Add a directive like: \"Structure the summary chronologically, detailing the cause-and-effect relationships between events. Focus on *what happens* in the story, not just descriptions of characters or settings.\"\n\n2.  **Lack of Emphasis on Narrative Arc:** The prompt mentioned \"Chronological Order & Causality\" but didn't strongly enforce it. The generated answer jumped between different entities and concepts without a clear narrative progression.\n\n    *   **Improvement:** Rephrase this instruction to be more directive. For example: \"Establish a clear narrative arc: Begin with the setup/exposition, describe the rising action and conflict, detail any significant turning points or climax, and conclude with the resolution or current state. Ensure each event flows logically from the previous one.\"\n\n3.  **Insufficient Guidance on Character Roles and Connections:** The prompt asked for \"Main Characters\" and \"Character Goals & Motivations,\" but the output failed to clarify the protagonist(s) or the specific relationships and conflicts driving the plot. The ambiguity around Willard and his connection to the \"Mary Lou\" and \"Ghost Ship\" is a prime example.\n\n    *   **Improvement:** Add a specific instruction to identify the primary protagonist(s) and clarify their roles and relationships within the plot. \"Clearly identify the protagonist(s) and their primary goals. Explain how different characters and entities (like the 'Ghost Ship' and 'Mary Lou') interact and influence each other's actions within the plot.\"\n\n4.  **Over-reliance on Description vs. Action:** The prompt asked for \"Key Events\" but didn't differentiate enough between descriptive statements and plot-driving actions. The output included many descriptive sentences (\"The 'Ghost Ship,' a legendary spectral vessel...\") rather than plot actions.\n\n    *   **Improvement:** Emphasize action verbs and plot progression. \"Prioritize describing *actions* and *events* that move the plot forward. Avoid lengthy descriptive passages or background information unless directly relevant to a plot event. Focus on verbs that indicate causality and progression.\"\n\n5.  **Granularity of Details:** The feedback noted that minor details were included that detracted from the plot summary. The prompt did not provide guidance on filtering these.\n\n    *   **Improvement:** Add a constraint to focus on significant plot points. \"Omit minor details, descriptive adjectives, or tangential information that do not directly contribute to understanding the main sequence of events and the central conflict. Focus only on what is essential to understand the plot's progression.\"\n\n**Revised Prompt Structure Suggestion:**\n\nThe prompt should be more focused on the *narrative structure* and *plot progression*.\n\n**Core Change:** Shift from \"synthesize plot elements\" to \"construct a chronological plot narrative.\"\n\n**Modified Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Query:** Analyze `{}`. Your summary must directly address this query, focusing on the story's events.\n2.  **Construct a Chronological Narrative:**\n    *   **Identify Protagonist(s) & Central Conflict:** Who is the main character(s), and what is the primary problem or goal driving the story?\n    *   **Sequence of Events:** Detail the main plot points *in the order they occur*. Describe the setup, rising action, key turning points, climax, and resolution.\n    *   **Cause and Effect:** Explain how events lead to subsequent events and impact characters.\n    *   **Character Actions & Motivations:** Focus on what characters *do* and *why*, as this drives the plot. Clarify their roles and relationships.\n3.  **Focus on Plot Drivers:** Prioritize actions and events that propel the narrative. Distinguish between descriptions of entities/settings and their roles/interactions within the plot.\n4.  **Filter for Significance:** Include only details essential for understanding the plot's progression. Omit minor descriptive elements or tangential information.\n5.  **Maintain Coherence & Conciseness:** Ensure a logical flow and avoid repetition.\n\nThis revised approach would more effectively guide the LLM to extract and synthesize information into a coherent, sequential plot summary, directly addressing the weaknesses identified.",
