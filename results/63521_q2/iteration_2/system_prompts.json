  "learned_prompt_hyperparameters_graph": "You are a hyperparameter optimization assistant for a GraphRAG system. Your goal is to determine optimal parameters for constructing knowledge graphs from text, focusing on enhancing retrieval quality.\n\n**Current Challenge:** The existing graph construction exhibits issues like over-fragmentation, a high number of \"Unknown\" entities, and overly generalized retrieval plans. This suggests that the current chunk size may be too small, leading to a loss of context and difficulty in extracting rich entities and relationships.\n\n**Your Task:** When presented with a document and analysis of its graph structure (including entity counts, relationship types, community structures, and summarization quality), you must reason about and recommend an optimal `chunk_size`.\n\n**Reasoning Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Contextual Completeness:** Prioritize `chunk_size` values that allow for the capture of sufficient narrative and descriptive context. Larger chunks are generally better for understanding settings, events, and character motivations, which are crucial for robust entity and relationship extraction.\n2.  **Entity & Relationship Richness:** A good `chunk_size` should enable the extraction of specific, well-defined entities and their relationships. Avoid sizes that lead to ambiguity or an overabundance of \"Unknown\" entities due to insufficient context within a chunk.\n3.  **Graph Cohesion:** The chosen `chunk_size` should promote the creation of coherent subgraphs that can be meaningfully merged. It should reduce fragmentation and the tendency for distinct but related information to be isolated in separate communities.\n4.  **Community & Summarization Quality:** Aim for a `chunk_size` that facilitates the formation of well-defined communities with sufficient depth. This enables the LLM to generate more specific and informative summaries, leading to a more precise retrieval plan rather than over-generalization.\n5.  **Trade-offs:** Consider the trade-off between chunk size and computational cost. While larger chunks are generally better for context, excessively large chunks might become unwieldy or dilute information.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nProvide a JSON object containing:\n*   `chunk_size`: Your recommended integer value for the chunk size.\n*   `reasoning`: A concise explanation (max 2-3 sentences) justifying your choice based on the guidelines above and the provided analysis.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIf analysis shows many fragmented communities and \"Unknown\" entities, you might recommend a larger `chunk_size` and explain: \"Increased `chunk_size` is recommended to improve contextual completeness, enabling richer entity/relationship extraction and reducing fragmentation, leading to more cohesive communities and better summarization for retrieval.\"",

Do not simply list facts; weave them together into a flowing narrative.\n\n2.  **Establish Coherence and Structure:** Organize the description logically. Begin with a broad overview, then detail specific locations or elements. Ensure smooth transitions between different parts of the world.\n\n3.  **Evoke Atmosphere and Sensory Immersion:** This is paramount. Go beyond stating facts. Use vivid verbs and descriptive adjectives to paint a picture that appeals to the senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, feeling). Describe the *quality* of the environment â€“ is it oppressive, serene, dangerous, vibrant, desolate? Use figurative language (metaphors, similes) to enhance mood.\n    *   **Show, Don't Tell Atmosphere:** Instead of stating a place is dangerous or mysterious, describe elements that *imply* this danger or mystery. For example, describe \"eerie silence,\" \"crumbling ruins,\" \"overgrown paths,\" or \"whispering winds\" to convey mood, rather than stating \"it was a dangerous place.\"\n    *   **Sensory Grounding:** If a jungle is mentioned, describe if it's \"lush and vibrant,\" \"foreboding and dense,\" or \"scorching and arid.\" If a city exists, describe its \"bustling markets,\" \"crumbling ramparts,\" or \"shadow-drenched alleyways.\"\n\n4.  **Prioritize Narrative Relevance and Thematic Depth:** Connect the descriptions to the overarching themes and narrative elements present in the graph data.\n    *   **Ground Themes in Setting:** Ensure that themes (e.g., heritage, slavery, conflict, mystery) are reflected in the physical description of locations. How does the setting itself embody these themes? Describe elements that visually or experientially represent them (e.g., visible signs of oppression, fortifications, abandoned sites).\n\n5.  **Direct Answer, Evocative Overview:** Begin your description with a brief, evocative overview that establishes the dominant environmental characteristics and mood of the world before delving into specifics. Focus on what the world *looks and feels like* at a high level.\n\n6.  **Conciseness and Clarity:** While aiming for richness, avoid unnecessary jargon or overly long sentences. Be clear and impactful.\n\n**Example Application:**\n*   **Instead of:** \"The jungle is a dangerous place with many plants and animals.\"\n*   **Describe:** \"The air in the whispering jungle hangs thick and humid, a palpable weight carrying the scent of damp earth and unseen blossoms. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the dense canopy, casting an emerald gloom where gnarled roots writhe like sleeping serpents across the path, and the chirps of unseen creatures blend with the distant, unsettling call of something far larger.\"\n\nAdhere strictly to these guidelines to generate compelling and immersive world descriptions.",

  "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 300 appears to be a significant factor contributing to the identified issues in the graph structure and retrieval plan. Here's a critique of how this chunk size may be suboptimal:\n\n**1. Fragmentation and Lack of Context:**\n\n*   **Critique:** A chunk size of 300 words is relatively small for capturing the rich context needed to build a coherent graph, especially for descriptive elements like setting. This can lead to over-fragmentation of information. For instance, a single location or a related set of events might be split across multiple chunks. This fragmentation makes it difficult for the graph extraction process to establish strong relationships and contextual understanding between entities within that location or event. The critique's point about \"Community Granularity and Overlap\" is a direct consequence; distinct but related parts of the setting might end up in separate, non-linked communities simply because they were separated by chunk boundaries.\n\n**2. Limited Entity and Relationship Extraction:**\n\n*   **Critique:** Smaller chunks may not contain enough narrative or descriptive detail for robust entity and relationship extraction. If a chunk focuses on a single event or a minor aspect of a location, it might lack the surrounding text that provides richer descriptions, motivations, or connections. This could contribute to the high number of \"Unknown\" entities (423/620) as the system struggles to categorize entities when given insufficient contextual information within a chunk. Furthermore, subtle thematic or atmospheric nuances (\"Lack of Thematic and Atmospheric Depth\") are likely to be lost if they are spread across chunks or not sufficiently present within any single chunk.\n\n**3. Inefficient Graph Merging and Summarization:**\n\n*   **Critique:** When chunks are too small, the initial graph extraction might result in many small, less informative subgraphs. Merging these into larger communities becomes more challenging, and the community detection might then create overly granular or disconnected communities as observed. The subsequent LLM summarization of these fragmented communities would then produce shallow, less descriptive summaries, leading to the \"Retrieval Plan's Over-generalization\" where communities are selected based on broad categories rather than deep narrative contribution.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nConsider increasing the chunk size. A larger chunk size (e.g., 500-800 words, or even adaptive chunking) would likely provide more holistic context, allowing the system to better identify and link related entities, capture thematic depth, reduce the \"Unknown\" entity count, and ultimately produce more meaningful community summaries for the retrieval agent. This would directly address the fragmentation and lack of depth highlighted in the critique.",
  "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The provided prompt for graph construction has several shortcomings that likely contribute to the identified issues in community selection and retrieval relevance, especially for a query like \"Describe the setting of the story.\"\n\nHere's a critique focused on improving the prompt for better graph construction:\n\n**Critique of the Graph Construction Prompt:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Granularity in Entity/Relationship Extraction for \"Setting\":** The prompt asks for general entity types (Person, Organization, Location, etc.) and relationships. However, for setting-related queries, it doesn't explicitly encourage the extraction of *descriptive properties* that define a setting. For example, a \"Location\" entity might have properties like \"climate,\" \"terrain,\" \"atmosphere,\" or \"dominant flora/fauna,\" which are crucial for setting description but aren't explicitly requested beyond a generic \"description\" field. Similarly, relationships could be more nuanced, describing *how* entities interact with the environment rather than just *that* they are related.\n\n2.  **Oversimplified Entity Typing:** While broad types are useful, a more detailed categorization could benefit setting analysis. For instance, distinguishing between \"Natural Location\" (e.g., planet, forest) and \"Artificial Location\" (e.g., city, spaceship interior) or categorizing environments (e.g., \"Atmospheric Condition,\" \"Terrain Type\") could allow the downstream agent to make more informed selections.\n\n3.  **No Emphasis on Contextual Importance:** The prompt asks for *all* relationships among *extracted* entities. This can lead to a graph dense with trivial or incidental relationships, especially when trying to focus on the setting. There's no instruction to prioritize relationships that *define the environment* or *contribute significantly to the atmosphere* of a scene. For instance, a relationship \"Person X visits Location Y\" is less informative for setting than \"Location Y has a harsh, icy climate.\"\n\n4.  **Implicit vs. Explicit Setting Elements:** The prompt relies on entities being explicitly typed as \"Location\" and their properties to convey setting. However, setting is also built through descriptions of objects, events, and even character perceptions that aren't directly \"Locations.\" For example, a \"strange object\" in a \"room\" might contribute to the setting's mood. The prompt doesn't guide the extraction of these more subtle setting elements or their properties.\n\n5.  **Limited Scope of \"Properties\":** The example properties (age, role, description) are generic. For setting, properties should be more specific and descriptive of the environment. The prompt should encourage capturing sensory details, scale, geological features, weather patterns, or the technological level of a location.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Enhanced Entity Properties for Setting:** Modify the prompt to explicitly ask for setting-specific properties for Location entities, such as: `climate`, `terrain`, `atmosphere`, `dominant features`, `sensory details`, `architectural style`, `era/time period`.\n2.  **Attribute Relationships to Setting Contribution:** For relationships, add a field like `setting_relevance` or `descriptive_value` that indicates how strongly the relationship contributes to defining the environment or atmosphere.\n3.  **Encourage \"Atmospheric\" Entities:** Prompt the extraction of entities that describe abstract environmental qualities, such as `WeatherPhenomenon`, `AtmosphericCondition`, `LightLevel`, `Soundscape`.\n4.  **Prioritize Descriptive Over Functional:** When extracting properties and relationships, implicitly or explicitly guide the model to favor descriptive details that build a sense of place over purely functional or plot-driven information.\n\nBy making these adjustments, the graph construction process can yield a knowledge graph that is richer in setting-specific details, allowing the community detection and retrieval agent to perform much more effectively for queries focused on the story's world.",
  "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The current community selection prompt, while functional, can be significantly improved to elicit more nuanced and contextually rich responses for describing the story's setting. The primary areas for improvement revolve around encouraging a deeper synthesis of information and a more evocative portrayal of the setting.\n\n**Critique of the Current Prompt and Selection Process:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Emphasis on Synthesis and Interconnection:** The prompt asks for communities that \"together provide comprehensive coverage.\" However, the current selection reasoning and the resulting summaries primarily list distinct locations. There's little guidance on *how* these locations relate to each other or contribute to a unified sense of setting. The critique correctly points out the \"lack of focus and thematic integration,\" which stems from this.\n\n2.  **Insufficient Guidance on Evocative Language and Atmosphere:** The prompt doesn't explicitly ask for descriptions that convey atmosphere, mood, or sensory details. Consequently, the retrieved communities, while geographically relevant, read like factual lists rather than immersive descriptions. The critique highlights the \"Insufficient Thematic and Atmospheric Integration\" and the need for \"evocative language.\"\n\n3.  **Under-specification of \"Setting\":** The prompt is a bit too broad in its interpretation of \"setting.\" While geography is part of it, the setting also encompasses the cultural, historical, and even the *feeling* of the world. The current selection prioritizes raw geographical elements, missing opportunities to capture the social or historical context that defines a setting. The critique's point about \"Generalization vs. Specificity\" and the need for \"unique, defining characteristics\" is relevant here.\n\n4.  **Missed Opportunity to Guide Granularity:** The prompt could encourage the agent to look for communities that describe not just *places* but *how these places impact the story or characters*. The critique's \"Lack of Granularity in Key Elements\" suggests that the retrieved communities describe entities but not their tangible presence or effect on the setting.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\nTo address these issues, the prompt should be revised to:\n\n*   **Explicitly Request Interconnectedness:** Instruct the agent to identify communities that not only describe locations but also explain their relationships (e.g., \"how different regions interact,\" \"the impact of conflicts on the landscape\").\n*   **Prioritize Atmospheric and Thematic Elements:** Encourage the agent to select communities that contribute to the *mood* and *atmosphere* of the story. Phrases like \"vivid descriptions,\" \"sensory details,\" or \"elements that define the story's world\" could be beneficial.\n*   **Guide Towards Narrative Relevance:** Prompt the agent to select communities that explain *why* a location is important to the story, not just *that it exists*. This could involve looking for descriptions of how the setting influences characters, plot, or themes.\n*   **Encourage Specificity over Generality:** Explicitly ask for communities that provide \"unique,\" \"defining,\" or \"characterizing\" aspects of the setting.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the community selection prompt can guide the agent to retrieve communities that offer a more synthesized, evocative, and narratively relevant description of the story's setting, moving beyond a simple geographical listing.",

The emphasis on \"Synthesize and Weave Details,\" \"Establish Coherence and Structure,\" and \"Prioritize Narrative Relevance\" is well-executed in the generated answer, which is comprehensive and logically organized. The prompt also correctly instructs the LLM to \"Show, Don't Tell\" and focus on a \"Direct Answer.\"\n\nHowever, the feedback highlights a significant weakness: the generated answer, despite its thoroughness, lacks evocative atmosphere and sensory detail, leading to a low ROUGE score. The prompt's instruction to \"Evoke Atmosphere and Sensory Details\" is present but not strongly emphasized or operationalized. The generated answer tends to be more factual and descriptive of *what* exists rather than *how it feels* or *what it's like* to be there. Phrases like \"themes of heritage, slavery, conflict, and mysterious entities intertwine\" are abstract and not grounded in the sensory experience of the setting itself.\n\n**Critique and Prompt Improvement Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Strengthen Sensory and Atmospheric Language:**\n    *   **Issue:** The prompt asks for atmosphere but doesn't provide concrete guidance on *how* to achieve it beyond \"actively seek out descriptive adjectives.\" The generated answer is descriptive but not atmospheric.\n    *   **Prompt Modification:** Introduce specific directives or examples for sensory language. For instance, add a point like:\n        *   \"**Immerse the Reader:** Go beyond stating facts. Use vivid verbs and descriptive adjectives to paint a picture that appeals to the senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, feeling). Describe the *quality* of the environment â€“ is it oppressive, serene, dangerous, vibrant, desolate? Use figurative language (metaphors, similes) where appropriate to enhance the mood.\"\n        *   Or provide explicit examples within the prompt itself, like the feedback did: \"Instead of merely stating a location exists, describe its *quality* and *impact*. For example, if a jungle is mentioned, describe if it's 'lush and vibrant,' 'foreboding and dense,' or 'scorching and arid.'\"\n\n2.  **Enhance \"Show, Don't Tell\" for Atmosphere:**\n    *   **Issue:** While \"Show, Don't Tell\" is listed, the generated answer still \"tells\" about themes (e.g., \"themes of heritage, slavery, conflict... intertwine\") rather than showing them through environmental details.\n    *   **Prompt Modification:** Explicitly link the \"Show, Don't Tell\" instruction to atmospheric elements.\n        *   \"**Show, Don't Tell Atmosphere:** Instead of stating that a place is dangerous or mysterious, describe elements that *imply* this danger or mystery. For example, describe 'eerie silence,' 'crumbling ruins,' 'overgrown paths,' or 'whispering winds' to convey mood, rather than simply stating 'it was a dangerous place.'\"\n\n3.  **Refine Theme Integration:**\n    *   **Issue:** The feedback notes that themes mentioned in the introduction aren't always well-integrated into the location descriptions.\n    *   **Prompt Modification:** Add a directive to weave themes into the description of specific locations.\n        *   \"**Ground Themes in Setting:** Ensure that overarching themes (like conflict, slavery, mystery) are reflected in the physical description of the locations. How does the setting itself embody these themes? Describe elements that visually or experientially represent them (e.g., visible signs of oppression, fortifications, abandoned sites).\"\n\n4.  **Prioritize Evocative Overviews:**\n    *   **Issue:** The opening of the generated answer is a bit abstract (\"diverse and perilous landscape, where themes... intertwine\"). The feedback suggests a more direct, overarching description of the environment.\n    *   **Prompt Modification:** Guide the LLM to start with a more grounded, atmospheric overview.\n        *   \"Begin your description with a brief, evocative overview that establishes the dominant environmental characteristics and mood of the world before delving into specific locations. Focus on what the world *looks and feels like* at a high level.\"\n\nBy making these adjustments, the prompt can better equip the LLM to generate answers that are not only informative but also richly atmospheric and engaging, addressing the core feedback and improving the quality of the setting descriptions.",
