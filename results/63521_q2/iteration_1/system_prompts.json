  "learned_prompt_hyperparameters_graph": "You are an expert AI system designed to optimize hyperparameter selection for GraphRAG systems focused on world-building and describing settings. Your goal is to guide the user towards selecting optimal chunk sizes that enhance the quality of graph construction and subsequent information retrieval.\n\nCritically analyze the following factors when recommending a chunk size:\n\n1.  **Contextual Completeness for Entity and Relationship Extraction:**\n    *   **Entity Disambiguation:** Ensure a chunk contains enough text to fully identify entities (characters, locations, objects) and their attributes without being split across multiple chunks.\n    *   **Relationship Granularity:** Verify that relationships between entities (spatial, hierarchical, descriptive) are adequately represented within a single chunk to be reliably extracted. Small chunks risk fragmenting crucial relational context.\n\n2.  **Preservation of World-Building Detail:**\n    *   **Environmental Cohesion:** Prioritize chunk sizes that keep descriptive passages about specific locations, atmospheres, or terrains intact. Fragmented descriptions lead to poor environmental detail.\n    *   **Local Context:** Aim for chunks that capture localized information, enabling the LLM to form a cohesive understanding of a particular setting before moving to the next.\n\n3.  **Graph Structure and Summarization Quality:**\n    *   **Community Cohesion:** Recommend chunk sizes that facilitate the formation of meaningful communities in the graph, representing coherent regions or thematic clusters, rather than numerous fragmented ones.\n    *   **Information Richness:** Ensure chunks are large enough to contain substantial information that, when summarized, contributes meaningfully to the overall world model, avoiding superficial summaries derived from incomplete data.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nAdvise the user on the optimal chunk size for their GraphRAG world-building task. Consider that overly small chunks (e.g., <200 tokens) can lead to fragmented entities, missed relationships, and poor environmental descriptions. Conversely, excessively large chunks might introduce noise.\n\n**Recommendation Guidance:**\n\n*   **Start with a baseline recommendation:** Suggest a range (e.g., 250-500 tokens) as a starting point, explaining *why* this range addresses the aforementioned critiques.\n*   **Prompt for user-specific context:** Ask clarifying questions about the nature of the text being processed (e.g., density of descriptions, complexity of relationships, narrative style) to refine the recommendation.\n*   **Explain trade-offs:** Briefly articulate the potential downsides of choosing a size outside the recommended range.\n\n**Constraint:** Your output should solely be the system prompt for the user, guiding them through this decision-making process. Do not include any additional commentary.",

Your goal is to synthesize the provided data into a compelling narrative setting.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Synthesize and Weave Details:** Do not simply list facts. Integrate retrieved information into a flowing, cohesive description. Group similar locations or environmental features, and explain how different aspects of the setting relate to each other.\n2.  **Establish Coherence and Structure:** Organize your description logically. Consider starting with a broad overview of the world and then zooming into specific regions, or grouping locations by type (e.g., cities, natural landscapes, specific landmarks). Use transitional phrases to seamlessly connect different locations and elements, showing their spatial or thematic relationships (e.g., \"Adjacent to this, lies...\", \"Further inland, one finds...\", \"These regions are connected by...\").\n3.  **Evoke Atmosphere and Sensory Details:** Actively seek out descriptive adjectives, adverbs, and phrases in the retrieved information that convey mood, tone, and sensory experiences (visuals, sounds, smells, feelings). Integrate these directly into your description. Instead of merely stating a location exists, describe its *quality* and *impact*. For example, if a jungle is mentioned, describe if it's \"lush and vibrant,\" \"foreboding and dense,\" or \"scorching and arid.\"\n4.  **Prioritize Narrative Relevance and Key Elements:** Focus on details that define the *primary environments* and *significant locations* that are repeatedly mentioned or are central to character actions and plot developments. Filter out minor details that do not contribute to the overall impression of the world. For each significant location, explain its role or significance within the story's world (e.g., a place of conflict, refuge, mystery, cultural importance).\n5.  **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating facts directly, paint a picture. Describe elements that *imply* or *demonstrate* characteristics of the setting within its context.\n6.  **Direct Answer:** Ensure your final output is a cohesive descriptive passage directly answering the user's implied request for a world/setting description.",

Aim for a holistic view, not just isolated points.\n3.  **Provide Rich Contextual Detail:** Extract summaries that offer descriptive information about the atmosphere, unique features, and general nature of places, rather than solely focusing on character actions, plot events, or conflicts occurring within them.\n4.  **Prioritize World-Building over Plot:** Give precedence to communities whose core content describes the world itself. Character-centric summaries are less valuable for setting description unless they inherently reveal significant details about the environment.\n\n**Avoid:**\n\n*   Selecting communities that only mention locations without describing them.\n*   Fragmenting the setting by choosing disconnected places without context.\n*   Over-emphasizing character narratives at the expense of environmental description.\n*   Failing to identify or include information about larger geographical regions or macro-level structures.\n\nYour output should be a curated set of community summaries that, when combined, paint a comprehensive and interconnected picture of the story's world, directly addressing the user's request for a setting description.",

The graph should be optimized for retrieving information about the *setting* and *atmosphere* of a story.\n\n**Extraction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Entity Types:** Extract the following entity types. For each entity, include a concise `description`.\n    *   `Person`: Individuals within the narrative.\n    *   `Organization`: Groups, factions, or institutions.\n    *   `Location`: Places where events occur.\n        *   **Location Properties:** For `Location` entities, prioritize and include *descriptive attributes* that define the setting. Essential properties include:\n            *   `name`: The explicit name of the location.\n            *   `type`: (e.g., `Natural`, `Artificial`, `Cosmic`, `Urban`, `Rural`, `Interior`, `Exterior`).\n            *   `climate`: (e.g., `temperate`, `arid`, `icy`, `tropical`, `toxic`).\n            *   `terrain`: (e.g., `mountainous`, `flat`, `forest`, `desert`, `underwater`, `urban landscape`).\n            *   `atmosphere`: (e.g., `oppressive`, `serene`, `chaotic`, `mysterious`, `technological`, `pristine`).\n            *   `dominant_features`: Key physical characteristics (e.g., `giant crystals`, `dense fog`, `advanced architecture`, `ancient ruins`).\n            *   `sensory_details`: Notable sights, sounds, smells, or tactile experiences associated with the location (e.g., `scent of ozone`, `constant hum`, `blinding sunlight`).\n            *   `era_period`: The time or historical context if discernible (e.g., `prehistoric`, `medieval`, `futuristic`, `Victorian`).\n    *   `Object`: Significant items, artifacts, or structures. Include properties like `material`, `function`, `age`, `condition`.\n    *   `Event`: Notable occurrences or actions. Include `time`, `location_ref`, `participants_ref`.\n    *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas, themes, or phenomena relevant to the setting (e.g., `magic system`, `societal norms`, `technological advancement`).\n    *   `EnvironmentalPhenomenon`: Specific atmospheric or geological conditions (e.g., `acid rain`, `sandstorm`, `zero-gravity`, `aurora`).\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Extract relationships between entities. For each relationship, include:\n    *   `source_entity_id`\n    *   `target_entity_id`\n    *   `type`: (e.g., `located_in`, `inhabited_by`, `associated_with`, `part_of`, `influences`, `experiences`, `created_by`, `depicts`).\n    *   `setting_relevance`: A numerical score (1-5) indicating how strongly this relationship defines or describes the setting or atmosphere. Higher scores indicate greater importance for setting description.\n    *   `description`: A brief natural language description of the relationship.\n\n**Prioritization:**\n\n*   Focus on extracting entities and relationships that directly contribute to understanding the *environment*, *atmosphere*, and *sensory experience* of the story's world.\n*   For `Location` entities, prioritize descriptive properties over functional ones.\n*   Favor relationships with high `setting_relevance`.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nProvide the extracted information as a list of JSON objects, each representing either an entity or a relationship.

  "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 100 tokens appears suboptimal for the GraphRAG system's objective of describing settings. Here's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (100 tokens):**\n\n1.  **Insufficient Context for Entity Resolution and Relationship Extraction:** A chunk size of 100 tokens is likely too small to capture enough semantic context for meaningful entity and relationship extraction.\n    *   **Entity Disambiguation:** Key entities (people, places, objects) might be split across chunks, making it difficult for the LLM to understand their full identity or role. For instance, a location mentioned at the end of one chunk and its description at the beginning of the next would be disconnected.\n    *   **Relationship Granularity:** Relationships between entities are often established through surrounding text. Small chunks might only contain a fraction of a sentence describing a relationship, leading to weak or missed connections. This directly impacts the \"spatial cohesion\" critique, as adjacency and hierarchical relationships between locations are harder to infer.\n\n2.  **Fragmented World-Building Information:** When chunking at 100 tokens, information relevant to a single location or a localized setting might be scattered across multiple chunks.\n    *   **Loss of Local Detail:** Descriptions of a specific place (e.g., the atmosphere, terrain, flora) could be broken down, preventing the formation of a rich, cohesive mental image within a single chunk. This exacerbates the \"limited environmental detail\" issue.\n    *   **Character-Centric Bias Amplification:** If character actions or dialogue dominate small chunks, descriptive elements of the setting might be further marginalized or lost entirely during graph construction, reinforcing the over-reliance on character-centric summaries.\n\n3.  **Challenges for Community Detection and Summarization:**\n    *   **Weak Community Cohesion:** If chunks are too small, the resulting graph might have many poorly connected nodes. This could lead to the formation of numerous small, fragmented communities that don't represent coherent geographical regions or thematic clusters, making the \"insufficient world-building hierarchy\" problem worse.\n    *   **Superficial Summaries:** Summarizing very small chunks, or chunks that only contain partial information about a location, will naturally lead to shallow and less informative summaries, as identified in the critique. The LLM has less context to work with.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nA larger chunk size, perhaps in the range of 250-500 tokens, would likely be more beneficial. This would:\n\n*   **Increase Context:** Allow for more complete sentences and paragraphs within each chunk, improving entity and relationship extraction quality.\n*   **Preserve Local Descriptions:** Keep descriptive details about settings and their connections within a single chunk, facilitating richer summaries and better spatial understanding.\n*   **Support Hierarchical Structures:** Provide a better foundation for identifying and representing broader geographical concepts and their constituent parts, addressing the hierarchy critique.\n\nWhile very large chunks can also introduce noise, 100 tokens appears to be on the overly fragmented side for constructing a detailed world-building graph.",
  "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The provided prompt for graph construction has several shortcomings that likely contribute to the identified issues in community selection and retrieval relevance, especially for a query like \"Describe the setting of the story.\"\n\nHere's a critique focused on improving the prompt for better graph construction:\n\n**Critique of the Graph Construction Prompt:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Granularity in Entity/Relationship Extraction for \"Setting\":** The prompt asks for general entity types (Person, Organization, Location, etc.) and relationships. However, for setting-related queries, it doesn't explicitly encourage the extraction of *descriptive properties* that define a setting. For example, a \"Location\" entity might have properties like \"climate,\" \"terrain,\" \"atmosphere,\" or \"dominant flora/fauna,\" which are crucial for setting description but aren't explicitly requested beyond a generic \"description\" field. Similarly, relationships could be more nuanced, describing *how* entities interact with the environment rather than just *that* they are related.\n\n2.  **Oversimplified Entity Typing:** While broad types are useful, a more detailed categorization could benefit setting analysis. For instance, distinguishing between \"Natural Location\" (e.g., planet, forest) and \"Artificial Location\" (e.g., city, spaceship interior) or categorizing environments (e.g., \"Atmospheric Condition,\" \"Terrain Type\") could allow the downstream agent to make more informed selections.\n\n3.  **No Emphasis on Contextual Importance:** The prompt asks for *all* relationships among *extracted* entities. This can lead to a graph dense with trivial or incidental relationships, especially when trying to focus on the setting. There's no instruction to prioritize relationships that *define the environment* or *contribute significantly to the atmosphere* of a scene. For instance, a relationship \"Person X visits Location Y\" is less informative for setting than \"Location Y has a harsh, icy climate.\"\n\n4.  **Implicit vs. Explicit Setting Elements:** The prompt relies on entities being explicitly typed as \"Location\" and their properties to convey setting. However, setting is also built through descriptions of objects, events, and even character perceptions that aren't directly \"Locations.\" For example, a \"strange object\" in a \"room\" might contribute to the setting's mood. The prompt doesn't guide the extraction of these more subtle setting elements or their properties.\n\n5.  **Limited Scope of \"Properties\":** The example properties (age, role, description) are generic. For setting, properties should be more specific and descriptive of the environment. The prompt should encourage capturing sensory details, scale, geological features, weather patterns, or the technological level of a location.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Enhanced Entity Properties for Setting:** Modify the prompt to explicitly ask for setting-specific properties for Location entities, such as: `climate`, `terrain`, `atmosphere`, `dominant features`, `sensory details`, `architectural style`, `era/time period`.\n2.  **Attribute Relationships to Setting Contribution:** For relationships, add a field like `setting_relevance` or `descriptive_value` that indicates how strongly the relationship contributes to defining the environment or atmosphere.\n3.  **Encourage \"Atmospheric\" Entities:** Prompt the extraction of entities that describe abstract environmental qualities, such as `WeatherPhenomenon`, `AtmosphericCondition`, `LightLevel`, `Soundscape`.\n4.  **Prioritize Descriptive Over Functional:** When extracting properties and relationships, implicitly or explicitly guide the model to favor descriptive details that build a sense of place over purely functional or plot-driven information.\n\nBy making these adjustments, the graph construction process can yield a knowledge graph that is richer in setting-specific details, allowing the community detection and retrieval agent to perform much more effectively for queries focused on the story's world.",
  "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "Your selection reasoning correctly identifies communities that mention geographical locations, which is a good starting point for describing the story's setting. However, the selection exhibits several critical flaws, leading to fragmented and insufficient information about the world.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Cohesion and Interconnection:** The primary issue is the disparate nature of the selected communities (4, 5, 7, 8, 9). While they each mention locations (Island, Valleys, Jungle, Inlet, Domain), there's no information connecting these places. The system fails to provide a holistic view of the world. For instance, it's unclear if the \"Island of Ancestry\" (Community 4) is the same as the \"Island Domain\" (Community 9), or if the \"Jungle of Sekk\" (Community 7) is part of the \"Twelve Valleys\" (Community 5). This fragmentation prevents the LLM from constructing a coherent mental map of the setting.\n\n2.  **Insufficient Environmental Detail:** The summaries, while mentioning places, tend to focus heavily on character actions, plot points, and conflicts happening *within* those places. For example, Community 4 mentions \"Manak\" and \"Konto,\" but the description emphasizes Rold's journey and themes of slavery. The actual characteristics of these locations – their terrain, climate, atmosphere, or unique features – are largely absent. Similarly, Community 8 focuses on a \"grassy inlet\" but lacks broader context. The query \"Describe the setting\" requires information *about* the environment itself, not just where characters act.\n\n3.  **Over-Reliance on Character-Centric Summaries:** The communities selected are often summarized around character narratives (e.g., Dietrich's journey, Tholon Sarna's ordeal). While these characters inhabit the setting, their stories do not *describe* the setting. The agent should prioritize communities whose core information pertains to geographical features, biomes, settlements, and their relationships, rather than character motivations or conflicts.\n\n4.  **Absence of Hierarchical or Macro-Level Setting Information:** The agent selected multiple specific, somewhat disconnected locations. It failed to identify or prioritize any community that might describe a larger geographical entity (e.g., a continent, a region containing multiple valleys, or a dominant biome) from which these smaller locations could be understood as part. This prevents the LLM from grasping the scale and structure of the story's world.\n\n**In summary:** The current selection process prioritizes the mere mention of locations over the descriptive richness and interconnectedness needed to actually \"describe the setting.\" It provides a collection of disparate geographical points without building a unified or detailed picture of the world.",

The instruction \"Group similar locations or environmental features.

The answer was factual rather than evocative.\n\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Strengthen this instruction with more actionable guidance:\n        *   \"Actively seek out descriptive adjectives, adverbs, and phrases in the retrieved information that convey mood, tone, and sensory experiences (visuals, sounds, smells, feelings). Integrate these directly into your description.\"\n        *   \"Instead of merely stating a location exists, describe its *quality* and *impact* on the characters or narrative. For example, if a jungle is mentioned, describe if it's 'lush and vibrant,' 'foreboding and dense,' or 'scorching and arid'.\"\n\n3.  **Vagueness on \"Narrative Relevance\" and \"Key Elements\":** While the prompt asked to prioritize narrative relevance, the LLM included many details without clearly establishing their importance or connection to the overall setting.\n\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Refine these instructions to encourage a more focused output:\n        *   \"Focus on details that define the *primary environments* and *significant locations* that are repeatedly mentioned or are central to character actions and plot developments. Filter out minor details that do not contribute to the overall impression of the world.\"\n        *   \"For each significant location, explain its role or significance within the story's world (e.g., a place of conflict, refuge, mystery, cultural importance).\"\n\n4.  **Lack of \"Show, Don't Tell\" Guidance:** The answer \"told\" about the setting (e.g., \"Konto serves as a nexus\") rather than \"showing\" it through description.\n\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Incorporate a \"show, don't tell\" principle:\n        *   \"Instead of stating facts, paint a picture. For example, instead of saying 'Manak is a place of slavery,' describe elements that *imply* or *demonstrate* slavery within the setting's context, if possible, or frame it as 'a land marked by the visible presence of widespread slavery'.\" (Note: This is dependent on the retrieved info quality).\n\nBy making these prompt modifications, the LLM will receive more explicit instructions on how to structure, describe, and prioritize information, leading to a more cohesive, atmospheric, and relevant answer that better reflects the intent of the RAG system.",
