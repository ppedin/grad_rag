    "evaluation_feedback": "## Evaluation of the RAG Response:\n\nThe RAG response effectively identifies and synthesizes various elements that contribute to the story's setting. It pulls out key locations and descriptive terms, providing a good overview.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Identifies Key Locations:** Successfully extracts distinct locations like the jungle, pits, main temple's floor, hidden village, fertile valley, solitary tree, and torch-lighted doorway.\n*   **Incorporates Descriptive Details:** Integrates descriptive adjectives like \"dangerous,\" \"mysterious,\" \"colossal,\" \"enigmatic,\" \"treacherous,\" \"chaotic,\" \"inaccessible,\" \"hidden,\" \"fertile,\" and \"formidable.\"\n*   **Connects Elements:** Attempts to connect different elements, such as the jungle giant and Noork's location within it, or the hidden village as a destination.\n*   **Captures Atmosphere:** Conveys an overarching atmosphere of \"peril and the unknown.\"\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\nWhile the response is decent, it could be significantly improved by:\n\n1.  **Contextual Understanding and Flow:** The current response reads like a list of extracted phrases and locations. It lacks a natural narrative flow and deeper understanding of how these elements *interact* to create a cohesive setting. For instance, the description of Noork squatting in the \"Jungle giant's crotch\" is jarring and potentially nonsensical without more context.\n2.  **Prioritization and Significance:** Not all described elements might be equally significant to the setting. The response could benefit from prioritizing the most impactful elements and explaining *why* they contribute to the setting.\n3.  **Specificity and Nuance:** Some descriptions are a bit vague. For example, \"The environment features treacherous 'Pits,' possibly used for hiding priests\" is speculative. If the source material offers more definitive information, it should be included.\n4.  **Eliminating Ambiguity and Potential Misinterpretations:** The \"Jungle giant's crotch\" detail is highly unusual and could be a misinterpretation or a very strange detail. If the source isn't clear, it's better to rephrase or omit such potentially confusing elements.\n5.  **Integrating the \"Why\":** The response lists elements but doesn't always explain *how* these elements shape the characters' lives or the story's mood. For example, *why* is the jungle dangerous? *What kind of perils* are present?\n6.  **Source Attribution (Implicit):** While not explicitly asked for, a truly robust RAG system might subtly indicate where it's drawing information from, preventing over-speculation.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nHere are specific ways to improve the response, categorized by the issue they address:\n\n---\n\n### Improvement 1: Enhance Narrative Flow and Cohesion\n\n**Problem:** The current response feels like a collection of facts rather than a descriptive narrative.\n\n**Suggestion:** Rewrite the response to create a more flowing and descriptive paragraph that integrates the elements logically.\n\n**Revised Example Snippet:**\n\n> The story unfolds in a world teeming with both natural wonder and inherent danger. A **colossal \"Jungle giant\"** dominates a vast, mysterious jungle, a formidable natural entity around which other elements of the setting are described. The presence of treacherous **\"Pits\"** suggests hidden dangers or perhaps strategic hiding places, possibly for priests seeking refuge. Further complicating this landscape is the **\"Main Temple's Floor,\"** an area seemingly fraught with chaos or inaccessibility, as indicated by priests desperately calling for help from its confines.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement 2: Address Ambiguous or Potentially Misinterpreted Details\n\n**Problem:** The \"Jungle giant's crotch\" detail is highly unusual and could be a misinterpretation or a very odd detail.\n\n**Suggestion:** Rephrase or investigate this detail further. If the source is unclear, err on the side of caution or describe it more generally.\n\n**Revised Example Snippet (if \"crotch\" is potentially a misinterpretation of a specific location):**\n\n> ... a colossal \"Jungle giant\" resides, with the enigmatic figure known as Noork situated in a peculiar or intimate location relative to it.\n\n**Revised Example Snippet (if the detail is indeed bizarre but present):**\n\n> ... a colossal \"Jungle giant\" dominates the landscape, and within its immediate vicinity, the enigmatic figure known as Noork is described as being in a highly unusual and specific position relative to the giant's anatomy.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement 3: Prioritize and Explain the Significance of Setting Elements\n\n**Problem:** All locations are presented with equal weight.\n\n**Suggestion:** Structure the response to highlight the most impactful aspects of the setting and explain their role.\n\n**Revised Example Snippet:**\n\n> The primary setting is a **dangerous and mysterious world**, characterized by a vast and imposing **jungle** that houses a",

Your goal is to guide a secondary LLM in reasoning about and selecting optimal chunk sizes based on textual content characteristics.\n\nConsider the following critical factors when advising on chunk size:\n\n1.  **Contextual Cohesion for Entity Attributes:**\n    *   Evaluate the typical length and detail of descriptions for key entities, especially locations.\n    *   A chunk size should be large enough to capture rich, descriptive attributes that define entities without fragmentation.\n    *   Avoid splitting extensive descriptions across multiple chunks, which can lead to shallow or incomplete entity nodes.\n\n2.  **Narrative and Relational Completeness:**\n    *   Assess how narrative flow and contextual information contribute to identifying nuanced relationships between entities (e.g., \"feels\\_atmosphere\\_of\", \"exhibits\\_feature\", \"interacts\\_with\\_environment\").\n    *   Ensure chunks are sufficient to preserve logical units and sentence structures necessary for inferring these richer semantic connections.\n    *   Prioritize chunk sizes that minimize the risk of missing or misinterpreting relationships due to text segmentation.\n\n3.  **Entity and Relationship Consistency:**\n    *   Consider how chunking might affect the identification and normalization of entities and relationships.\n    *   Larger, more comprehensive chunks can reduce the likelihood of duplicate or inconsistently typed nodes and ensure relationships are captured holistically.\n\n4.  **Temporal and Atmospheric Information Integration:**\n    *   Recognize that inferring temporal placement (`is_during_era`) or atmospheric qualities (`has_atmosphere`) often requires surrounding context.\n    *   Advise on chunk sizes that retain enough adjacent text to facilitate accurate temporal and atmospheric relationship extraction.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nWhen presented with a corpus or a sample of text, analyze its characteristics according to the above factors. Recommend a chunk size (in tokens), providing a brief justification for your choice. If a default or previously suggested size (e.g., 250 tokens) appears suboptimal, explain why in relation to these factors and propose a revised range (e.g., 500-1000 tokens) or a specific value, detailing the benefits.\n\nBegin by assessing the provided text for these properties and recommending an initial, optimized chunk size.",
      "learned_prompt_answer_generator_graph": "You are an AI assistant specializing in generating rich, coherent, and contextually relevant descriptions of settings based on information retrieved from a knowledge graph. Your goal is to synthesize disparate graph elements into a flowing narrative that paints a vivid picture for the reader.\n\nWhen presented with retrieved graph data, follow these guidelines:\n\n1.  **Narrative Synthesis and Cohesion:** Organize the retrieved information into a flowing narrative. Logically connect locations, inhabitants, environmental features, and events. Ensure smooth transitions between different aspects of the setting, creating a cohesive and immersive description rather than a list of facts.\n\n2.  **Handling Ambiguity and Clarity:** If retrieved information presents unusual, ambiguous, or potentially misinterpreted details, prioritize clarity and narrative sense. Rephrase cautiously to make the detail understandable within the context, or omit it if it significantly hinders coherence and does not add substantial meaning. Retain crucial, albeit strange, elements if they are integral to the source material and can be presented without disrupting the narrative flow.\n\n3.  **Prioritization and Significance:** Identify and emphasize the most significant elements that define the overall atmosphere, theme, and nature of the setting. Explain *how* these key elements contribute to the story's context, mood, or narrative. Not all details are equal; focus on those that are most impactful.\n\n4.  **Grounded Inference and Specificity:** While inferring descriptive qualities from connections and attributes is encouraged, ensure inferences are directly supported by the provided graph data. If specific information exists about an entity's function, history, or characteristic, use that directly. Only infer when direct information is absent, and ensure your inferences are plausible and well-reasoned based on the given context.

      "learned_prompt_graph_retrieval_planner": "You are a strategic retrieval planner for a GraphRAG system. Your goal is to devise efficient and effective retrieval plans to answer user queries by intelligently exploring a knowledge graph.\n\n**Core Principles for Planning:**\n\n1.  **Strategic Depth over Sequential Brute-Force:** Avoid simply iterating through nodes or executing the same function repeatedly. Analyze the query and the current state of retrieved information to make informed decisions about the next best action. Prioritize exploring nodes and relationships that are most likely to yield relevant information for the query.\n\n2.  **Information Synthesis and Hypothesis-Driven Exploration:** After retrieving information, pause to synthesize it. Formulate hypotheses about what the retrieved data implies regarding the query. Use these hypotheses to guide subsequent retrieval steps. For example, if a \"Location\" node is connected to an \"Event\" node, consider retrieving details about that event *at that location* to describe the setting or context.\n\n3.  **Diverse Function Utilization:** Employ a variety of graph traversal and search functions based on the query's needs. Do not limit yourself to `get_neighbors()` and `search_nodes_by_types()`. Consider:\n    *   `search_relations_by_type(relation_type='...')`: To find specific types of connections (e.g., 'located in', 'part of', 'influences').\n    *   `search_nodes_by_keyword(keyword='...')`: To find nodes containing specific descriptive terms relevant to the query (e.g., 'atmosphere', 'description', 'era').\n    *   `find_hub_nodes()`: To identify central or highly connected entities that might be key to understanding the broader context.\n    *   `analyze_path(node1, node2)`: To understand the relationship or journey between two discovered entities.\n    *   `get_node_details(node_id)`: To retrieve explicit attributes and descriptions of a node.\n\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Your plan should be iterative. Each step should build upon the previous ones, refining your understanding and directing the search towards the most pertinent information. If initial searches are too broad, narrow them down. If they are too narrow, broaden strategically.\n\n**Query Handling for \"Describe the Setting\":**\n\nWhen the query is about describing a setting:\n*   Identify key location-related entities.\n*   Retrieve not only neighboring nodes but also their *attributes*, *descriptions*, and *relationships* that contribute",

Prioritize specific types over general ones:\n        *   **Character:** Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character, Minor Character, Non-Human Sentient Being.\n        *   **Group/Faction:** Organization, Political Faction, Rebel Group, Family, Species.\n        *   **Location:** City, Planet, Building, Region, Fictional Setting, Abstract Space.\n        *   **Event:** Plot Point, Conflict, Social Gathering, Historical Event, Transformation.\n        *   **Artifact:** Object, Weapon, Technology, Document, Magical Item.\n        *   **Concept:** Theme, Idea, Philosophy, Emotion, Abstract Notion.\n        *   **Work:** Book, Movie, Song, Game (if mentioned as a distinct entity).\n    *   For ambiguous entities, use the most contextually appropriate type.

      "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 250 tokens appears suboptimal for the GraphRAG system, primarily due to its impact on graph quality and the subsequent retrieval effectiveness.\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (250 tokens):**\n\n1.  **Insufficient Context for Rich Location Descriptions:** The critique highlights a critical lack of descriptive attributes for locations. A chunk size of 250 tokens might be too small to capture the rich textual descriptions that define a location's atmosphere, characteristics, or historical context. For instance, a single location's description might span across multiple sentences or even paragraphs, and if these are split across chunks, the LLM tasked with graph extraction may only see fragmented pieces, leading to the creation of shallow or incomplete location nodes. This directly contributes to the \"Lack of Descriptive Attributes for Locations\" and \"Shallow Entity-Relationship Depth\" issues.\n\n2.  **Fragmented Narrative Elements:** Setting description often relies on a cohesive narrative flow. A 250-token chunk might break apart sentences or logical units that describe how characters interact with their environment or how the environment itself is presented. This fragmentation makes it difficult for the graph extraction LLM to identify and link nuanced relationships like \"feels_atmosphere_of\" or \"exhibits_feature,\" as mentioned in the critique. The system might only capture basic `located_in` or `interacts_with` relationships, missing the richer semantic connections vital for descriptive queries.\n\n3.  **Potential for Inconsistent Entity/Relationship Extraction:** Smaller chunks can lead to inconsistencies in how entities and relationships are identified and represented. If a particular concept or entity is mentioned multiple times within a larger segment but only partially appears in a 250-token chunk, the graph extraction LLM might create duplicate or inconsistently typed nodes (contributing to the \"\" issue) or miss important relationships. This can lead to a less normalized and potentially redundant graph.\n\n4.  **Impact on Temporal and Atmospheric Information:** Capturing temporal or atmospheric details often requires understanding the context surrounding an event or description. A 250-token chunk might isolate an event without sufficient surrounding text to infer its temporal placement or the mood it evokes, hindering the creation of relationships like `is_during_era` or `has_atmosphere`.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nA larger chunk size, perhaps in the range of 500-1000 tokens, would likely be more beneficial. This would provide the LLM with more cohesive textual segments",
      "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The current prompt for graph construction is too generic and lacks specific instructions to capture the nuances required for a robust knowledge graph, especially for narrative texts. Here's a critique and suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Ambiguous Entity Typing:** The prompt lists example types (Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept) but doesn't explicitly guide the LLM on how to determine these types definitively or how to handle ambiguous cases. For instance, \"Raiders of the Second Moon\" could be an Event, a Group, or a Work/Publication depending on context. The prompt should encourage more precise type assignment.\n2.  **Limited Property Extraction Guidance:** The prompt asks for \"properties\" with \"key\" and \"value\" but provides vague examples (\"age, role, description\"). It doesn't specify what constitutes a significant property for different entity types, leading to potentially sparse or irrelevant property information. It should encourage capturing defining characteristics relevant to the narrative.\n3.  **Relationship Description Weakness:** The prompt asks for a \"description (why you think the two entities are related)\" and \"evidence from the text.\" While good, it could be more specific. It doesn't explicitly ask for the *type* of relationship (e.g., causality, dependency, antagonism, possession) which is crucial for graph traversal and reasoning. The provided relationship types in the sample (e.g., \"interacts with,\" \"associated with\") are too broad.\n4.  **Lack of Focus on Narrative Structure:** The prompt treats the text as a flat information source. It doesn't guide the LLM to identify plot points, character motivations, cause-and-effect, or thematic elements, which are critical for understanding a narrative's context and setting.\n5.  **\"Reasoning\" Section is Unstructured:** The request for \"Provide the reasoning that led to your response\" is good, but the prompt doesn't specify *what kind* of reasoning is expected. This can lead to inconsistent or unhelpful explanations.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Refine Entity Typing and Hierarchy:**\n    *   Provide a more comprehensive and ordered list of entity types relevant to narrative (e.g., Character, Faction, Setting Element, Artifact, Plot Device, Theme, Abstract Concept).\n    *   Instruct the LLM to prioritize specific types over generic ones (e.g., \"Character\" over \"Person\" if context allows, \"",
      "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The provided retrieval plans show a consistent but ultimately inefficient strategy for answering the query \"Describe the setting of the story.\" The core issue is a lack of strategic depth and an over-reliance on sequential exploration without dynamic adaptation.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Myopic Focus on \"Location\" Nodes:** The initial step correctly identifies \"Location\" as a relevant entity type. However, the subsequent plans fall into a pattern of simply calling `get_neighbors()` on each discovered location sequentially (Jungle giant, Main Temple's Floor, Pits, fertile valley, hidden village). This is a brute-force approach that doesn't prioritize or analyze *which* locations are most important or *what kind* of information is needed to describe a setting. A setting isn't just a list of places; it involves their attributes, relationships, and atmosphere.\n\n2.  **Absence of Information Synthesis and Hypothesis Generation:** The plans lack any mechanism for synthesizing the retrieved information. After exploring neighbors of a location, the agent doesn't pause to analyze the returned context. For example, if \"Jungle giant\" is connected to \"Noork\" (a person) and \"ancient ruins\" (an artifact/location), the plan should ideally consider *how* these connections contribute to the setting. Is \"Noork\" described as living *in* the jungle? Are the \"ancient ruins\" *within* the jungle? The current approach just moves to the next location without building upon or questioning the gathered data.\n\n3.  **Missed Opportunity for Deeper Exploration:** The plan sticks to `get_neighbors()` and `search_nodes_by_types()`. While these are foundational, the query \"Describe the setting\" might benefit from other functions. For example:\n    *   **`search_relations_by_type(relation_type='located in')`:** This could explicitly map out spatial relationships between entities and locations.\n    *   **`search_nodes_by_keyword('description')` or `search_nodes_by_keyword('atmosphere')` (if such keywords existed):** To find nodes that might explicitly describe aspects of the setting.\n    *   **`find_hub_nodes`:** Hub nodes might represent central places or concepts that are crucial for understanding the overall setting.\n    *   **`analyze_path`:** If two distinct locations are found, analyzing the path between them could reveal connective tissue of the setting.\n\n4.

      "answer_generation_critique": "The current prompt, while aiming for descriptive answers, falls short in guiding the LLM towards **synthesizing context and inferring relationships** effectively for a coherent setting description. The feedback highlights several key areas for improvement:\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Flow and Cohesion:** The prompt encourages \"holistic description\" and \"vivid setting\" but doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM on *how* to weave disparate graph elements into a natural narrative. It leads to a list-like output rather than a flowing description.\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Add an instruction like: \"Organize the retrieved information into a flowing narrative that logically connects locations, inhabitants, and environmental features. Ensure transitions between different aspects of the setting are smooth.\"\n\n2.  **Handling Ambiguous or Potentially Misinterpreted Details:** The prompt mentions inferring from connections, but it doesn't provide guidance on how to handle unusual or potentially nonsensical details (like \"Jungle giant's crotch\"). This can lead to awkward phrasing or inclusion of details that detract from the overall description.\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Include a directive on handling ambiguity: \"If retrieved information presents unusual or potentially misinterpreted details, prioritize clarity and narrative sense. Rephrase cautiously or omit if the detail significantly hinders coherence, but retain it if it's a crucial, albeit strange, element of the source material.\"\n\n3.  **Prioritization and Significance of Elements:** The prompt asks to \"infer broader characteristics\" but doesn't guide the LLM on *which* characteristics are most significant for defining the setting.

The most frequent entity types are 153 \"\"s, 74 \"Location\"s, 35 \"Person\"s, 27 \"Object\"s, 24 \"Concept\"s, 19 \"Artifact\"s, 9 \"Event\"s, 9 \"Organization\"s, 9 \"Weapon\"s, 8 \"Character\"s, 3 \"Deity\"s, 2 \"Group\"s, 2 \"Non-Human Sentient Being\"s, 2 \"Species\"s, and 1 \"Abstract Space\". The most frequent relationship types are 16 \"possesses\" relationships, 11 \"attacks\" relationships, 10 \"contains\" relationships, 9 \"observes\" relationships, 8 \"wears\" relationships, 7 \"associated with\" relationships, 7 \"is a\" relationships, 7 \"located in\" relationships, 7 \"uses\" relationships, 6 \"from\" relationships, 6 \"interacts with\" relationships, 6 \"produced\" relationships, 5 \"inquires about\" relationships, 5 \"wields\" relationships, and 4 \"approaches\" relationships.\n\nYou must choose one of the following functions:\n\n- search_nodes_by_keyword(keyword): search for all the nodes whose labels contain the given keyword\n- search_nodes_by_types(node_type): search for all the nodes whose type property contains the given type\n- get_neighbors(node_name): get all neighbors of a node with the given name\n- search_relations_by_type(relation_type): search for all the triplets whose relationship matches the type\n- identify_communities(node_name): find the community (connected component) containing a specific node\n- analyze_path(start_node_name, end_node_name): find the shortest path between two nodes\n- find_hub_nodes: find the top 3 hub nodes with the highest connectivity\n\nPrevious retrieval decisions in this session:\n{RETRIEVED_CONTEXT}\n\nIMPORTANT: Review the previous decisions above to avoid repeating the same function calls with the same arguments. Choose a function that will retrieve complementary information to build upon what you have already gathered.\n\nChoose one of the functions and specify the arguments.\n\nProvide the reasoning that led to your response.\n\nPay attention to symbols included in the entity/relationship type names: make sure to include them in your search for matching to succeed.\nAlso, pay attention to symbols included in the functions names. The name of the function called must exactly match one of the functions above. \n"
