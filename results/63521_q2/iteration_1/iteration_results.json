  "retrieved_context": "Community 4 - Island of Ancestry, Slavery, and Hidden Villages:\nThis community depicts a complex web of connections centered around individuals and locations with historical and familial ties, intertwined with themes of danger and escape. Rold, who was born on the island and whose people originate from the valley city of Konto, is linked to a girl who possesses a dagger and a bow, and whose destination is her brother's hidden village. Sarna, daughter of Tholon Dist, journeys through the valley of Konto and advocates against the slavery of Zurans. The island itself is a significant entity, being identified as Manak, the birthplace of Rold, and also the domain of unseen evil beings who have victimized the girl's friends. The narrative further highlights movements and actions, such as marching from Konto to Bis, and climbing towards a jungle matted ground outside a wall. This subgraph represents a story of heritage, the struggle against oppression, and perilous journeys, possibly hinting at an unfolding conflict or quest involving these diverse characters and places.\n\nCommunity 5 - Dietrich's Journey and the Twelve Valleys:\nThis community centers around Dietrich, a man from America, and his complex relationships and intentions. Dietrich expresses a desire to live peacefully with Gurn, but also reveals he was hunting Von Mark, who Gurn observes in his dying moments. Dietrich plans to live in the jungle, which is part of the twelve valleys and adjacent to the Lake of Uzdon. The city of Grath, connected to its namesake Grath, calls Gurn a traitor. A short powerful bow, given by Gurn, is also mentioned. Thematic elements include exile, conflict, desire for peace, and a sense of place within a vast, wild landscape.\n\nCommunity 7 - Tholon Sarna's Ordeal and the Jungle War:\nThis subgraph centers on Tholon Sarna, a figure who is \"is held in\" the \"prison pit\" but is also \"is near\" the \"door of interlocking brass strips,\" suggesting a confined yet accessible state. The entity \"Ud\" plays a crucial role, having \"delivered_message_to\" Tholon Sarna and being connected to both \"demons\" (by hunting near them) and the \"jungle of Sekk\" (as an inhabitant). Furthermore, Ud is \"is enemy of\" the \"valley cities,\" which are also in \"eternal war\" with the beast men from the jungle of Sekk. This community represents a narrative of captivity and conflict, where Tholon Sarna is a victim within a larger struggle between the inhabitants of Sekk's jungle and the valley cities, with Ud acting as a messenger and participant in this ongoing war.\n\nCommunity 8 - Dugout's Journey to the Grassy Inlet:\nThis community describes the spatial relationship between three entities: a dugout, a grassy inlet, and the mainland. The primary interaction highlighted is the dugout's movement, as it \"ran ashore in the grassy inlet.\" Furthermore, the grassy inlet itself is situated \"on the mainland,\" specifically within its marshy lowlands. This subgraph thus illustrates a journey and a location, depicting how a vessel (the dugout) came to rest in a specific geographical feature (the grassy inlet) which is part of a larger landmass (the mainland).\n\nCommunity 9 - The Misty Ones and their Island Domain:\nThis community focuses on the \"Misty Ones,\" enigmatic beings originating from an island in the Lake of Uzdon. They are identified as \"hooded and robed creatures\" and are from the Temple of the Skull. The Misty Ones interact with their environment and other entities in several ways: they have landing stages on the beach, which is opposite the Temple of Uzdon. They are perceived not as gods or demons but as living creatures, and they are not to be confused with ghostly servants of demons. The Misty Ones were targeted by fruit, and monsters flee from them. A slave expresses concern about being seen by them. The Misty Ones were also observed on a trail, and they reside in the Temple of the Skull. The Temple of Uzdon is implied to be guarded by cowardly warriors, similar to those of the Temple of the Skull. This subgraph represents a mysterious presence with a specific origin and territory, hinting at potential conflict or avoidance with other inhabitants and visitors to the region.",

The valley city of Konto serves as a nexus, a place of origin and a route for journeys, notably towards Bis, and is also where Sarna advocates against the enslavement of Zurans.\n\nDietrich, a man from America, finds himself in a region described as the \"twelve valleys,\" planning to reside in its jungle, which lies adjacent to the Lake of Uzdon. This lake is also the origin of the enigmatic \"Misty Ones,\" hooded and robed creatures from the Temple of the Skull. These beings possess landing stages on their island's beach, opposite the Temple of Uzdon, and are a source of fear for monsters and slaves alike, though they are neither gods nor demons.\n\nThe jungle of Sekk is a battleground for an ongoing \"eternal war\" between its beast men and the valley cities. Within this conflict, the entity \"Ud\" acts as a messenger and hunter, an inhabitant of Sekk's jungle, an enemy of the valley cities, and is near the \"door of interlocking brass strips\" within a \"prison pit\" where Tholon Sarna is held.\n\nOther locations include the marshy lowlands of the mainland, where a dugout runs ashore in a grassy inlet, and the city of Grath, which labels Gurn a traitor.

    "evaluation_feedback": "The ROUGE score of 0.1667 indicates that the response has a very low overlap with a potential ideal answer. This suggests the RAG system struggled to accurately and comprehensively capture the setting details from the provided context.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the response's strengths and weaknesses, along with suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Identifies multiple locations:** The response correctly identifies various places mentioned in the story, such as Manak, Konto, Bis, the twelve valleys, Lake of Uzdon, Sekk, Grath, etc.\n*   **Mentions key inhabitants/entities:** It lists some of the beings associated with these locations (e.g., unseen evil beings, Misty Ones, beast men, Ud).\n*   **Highlights conflicts/themes:** The response touches upon themes like slavery, eternal war, oppression, and perilous journeys.\n\n**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Cohesion and Flow:** The response reads like a list of facts rather than a descriptive narrative of the setting. The transitions between different locations and entities are abrupt.\n    *   **Improvement:** Organize the information geographically or thematically. Start with a general overview of the world and then delve into specific regions and their characteristics. Use transition words and phrases to connect different elements smoothly. For example, instead of jumping from Manak to Konto, you could say, \"From the island of Manak, the narrative shifts to the valley city of Konto...\"\n\n2.  **Vague Descriptions:** While locations are mentioned, their descriptive qualities (e.g., atmosphere, key features beyond just being a \"valley city\" or \"jungle\") are often missing or underspecified.\n    *   **Improvement:** Extract more evocative adjectives and sensory details from the source text. For instance, \"islands, valleys, jungles, and waterways\" is a good start, but what *kind* of islands, valleys, etc.? Are they lush, barren, mountainous, swampy? The response mentions \"perilous landscape,\" which is good, but this could be expanded upon.\n\n3.  **Inconsistent Level of Detail:** Some locations receive more detailed descriptions than others. For example, Manak is described with more nuance than Konto, which is primarily identified as a \"nexus.\"\n    *   **Improvement:** Aim for a more balanced representation of the key settings, ensuring that all prominently featured locations are described with a similar level of detail regarding their characteristics and significance.\n\n4.  **Over-reliance on Lists of Entities:** The response often lists entities associated with a location without fully integrating them into the description of the setting itself. For example, \"Manak... is the domain of unseen evil beings.\" This could be framed as \"Manak, Rold's birthplace, is known for its heritage and a pervasive sense of unseen evil that haunts its lands.\"\n    *   **Improvement:** Weave the inhabitants and entities into the description of the location. Explain *how* these beings contribute to the setting's atmosphere or its inherent dangers/characteristics.\n\n5.  **Unclear Importance of Locations:** The response doesn't always make it clear *why* a particular location is important to the story's setting. While it mentions \"nexus\" for Konto, the significance of other places isn't always articulated.\n    *   **Improvement:** Highlight the role or function of each described location within the broader narrative context. Is it a place of conflict, refuge, mystery, or a starting point for significant events?\n\n6.  **Redundancy:** Some phrases like \"is also\" are used repeatedly, making the writing less engaging.\n    *   **Improvement:** Vary sentence structure and vocabulary. Combine sentences where appropriate.\n\n7.  **Missed Nuances/Implications:** The response mentions \"slavery and hidden villages\" on Manak but doesn't fully explore the implications of this for the island's setting. Similarly, the \"Misty Ones\" are described factually but their role in creating a sense of dread or mystery could be emphasized more.\n    *   **Improvement:** Go deeper into the implications of the details provided. How do these social structures or supernatural elements shape the environment and the experiences of characters within it?\n\n**Specific Examples of How to Improve:**\n\n*   **Instead of:** \"Manak, an island of significant heritage, is Rold's birthplace and the domain of unseen evil beings. It is also implied to be a place of both slavery and hidden villages, suggesting a complex social structure and potential for conflict.\"\n    *   **Improvement:** \"The story's setting begins with the island of Manak, a place steeped in heritage and Rold's birthplace. This island is not merely a geographical location but is also characterized by the presence of unseen evil beings, hinting at a dark undercurrent. Furthermore, Manak harbors a complex social landscape, with indications of both widespread slavery and secluded hidden villages, suggesting a society rife with tension and hidden struggles.\"\n\n*   **Instead of:** \"The valley city of Konto serves as a nexus, a place of origin and a route for journeys, notably towards Bis, and is also where Sarna advocates against the enslavement of Zurans.\"\n    *   **Improvement:** \"The valley city of Konto stands as a crucial hub within the world, acting as a point of origin for journeys and a vital transit point towards Bis. Its significance is further underscored by Sarna's advocacy against the enslavement of Zurans, highlighting its role as a center for both passage and social discourse.\"\n\n*   **Instead of:** \"Dietrich, a man from America, finds himself in a region described as the 'twelve valleys,' planning to reside in its jungle, which lies adjacent to the Lake of Uzdon.\"\n    *   **Improvement:** \"The narrative then shifts to a region known as the 'twelve valleys,' a land of dense jungle where Dietrich, an outsider from America, intends to make his home. This jungle borders the enigmatic Lake of Uzdon...\"\n\n**Revised Response Structure Suggestion:**\n\n1.  **Introduction:** Briefly state the overall nature of the setting (e.g., diverse, perilous, ancient, war-torn).\n2.  **Island Settings:** Describe Manak, focusing on its heritage, dangers, and social complexities.\n3.  **Valley Cities and Hubs:** Detail Konto's function as a nexus, its connection to Bis, and its role in social issues. Mention the \"twelve valleys\" and their connection to Dietrich.\n4.  **Waterways and Mysterious Entities:** Describe Lake of Uzdon and the \"Misty Ones,\" emphasizing their mysterious and fearful nature.\n5.  **Jungle Environments:** Focus on the jungle of Sekk, highlighting the \"eternal war,\" its inhabitants (beast men), and the presence of \"Ud.\"\n6.  **Other Notable Areas:** Briefly mention the marshy lowlands and the city of Grath, if they contribute significantly to the overall impression of the setting.\n7.  **Concluding Summary:** Reiterate the overarching themes and atmosphere of the setting (e.g., ancient heritage, constant conflict, oppression, wild territories).\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can generate a more comprehensive, cohesive, and descriptive response that better captures the essence of the story's setting, leading to a significantly improved ROUGE score.",

Your goal is to guide the user towards selecting optimal chunk sizes that enhance the quality of graph construction and subsequent information retrieval.\n\nCritically analyze the following factors when recommending a chunk size:\n\n1.  **Contextual Completeness for Entity and Relationship Extraction:**\n    *   **Entity Disambiguation:** Ensure a chunk contains enough text to fully identify entities (characters, locations, objects) and their attributes without being split across multiple chunks.\n    *   **Relationship Granularity:** Verify that relationships between entities (spatial, hierarchical, descriptive) are adequately represented within a single chunk to be reliably extracted. Small chunks risk fragmenting crucial relational context.\n\n2.  **Preservation of World-Building Detail:**\n    *   **Environmental Cohesion:** Prioritize chunk sizes that keep descriptive passages about specific locations, atmospheres, or terrains intact. Fragmented descriptions lead to poor environmental detail.\n    *   **Local Context:** Aim for chunks that capture localized information, enabling the LLM to form a cohesive understanding of a particular setting before moving to the next.\n\n3.  **Graph Structure and Summarization Quality:**\n    *   **Community Cohesion:** Recommend chunk sizes that facilitate the formation of meaningful communities in the graph, representing coherent regions or thematic clusters, rather than numerous fragmented ones.\n    *   **Information Richness:** Ensure chunks are large enough to contain substantial information that, when summarized, contributes meaningfully to the overall world model, avoiding superficial summaries derived from incomplete data.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nAdvise the user on the optimal chunk size for their GraphRAG world-building task. Consider that overly small chunks (e.g., <200 tokens) can lead to fragmented entities, missed relationships, and poor environmental descriptions. Conversely, excessively large chunks might introduce noise.\n\n**Recommendation Guidance:**\n\n*   **Start with a baseline recommendation:** Suggest a range (e.g., 250-500 tokens) as a starting point, explaining *why* this range addresses the aforementioned critiques.\n*   **Prompt for user-specific context:** Ask clarifying questions about the nature of the text being processed (e.g., density of descriptions, complexity of relationships, narrative style) to refine the recommendation.\n*   **Explain trade-offs:** Briefly articulate the potential downsides of choosing a size outside the recommended range.\n\n**Constraint:** Your output should solely be the system prompt for the user, guiding them through this decision-making process.

Your goal is to synthesize the provided data into a compelling narrative setting.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Synthesize and Weave Details:** Do not simply list facts. Integrate retrieved information into a flowing, cohesive description. Group similar locations or environmental features, and explain how different aspects of the setting relate to each other.\n2.  **Establish Coherence and Structure:** Organize your description logically. Consider starting with a broad overview of the world and then zooming into specific regions, or grouping locations by type (e.g., cities, natural landscapes, specific landmarks). Use transitional phrases to seamlessly connect different locations and elements, showing their spatial or thematic relationships (e.g., \"Adjacent to this, lies...\", \"Further inland, one finds...\", \"These regions are connected by...\").\n3.  **Evoke Atmosphere and Sensory Details:** Actively seek out descriptive adjectives, adverbs, and phrases in the retrieved information that convey mood, tone, and sensory experiences (visuals, sounds, smells, feelings). Integrate these directly into your description. Instead of merely stating a location exists, describe its *quality* and *impact*. For example, if a jungle is mentioned, describe if it's \"lush and vibrant,\" \"foreboding and dense,\" or \"scorching and arid.\"\n4.  **Prioritize Narrative Relevance and Key Elements:** Focus on details that define the *primary environments* and *significant locations* that are repeatedly mentioned or are central to character actions and plot developments. Filter out minor details that do not contribute to the overall impression of the world. For each significant location, explain its role or significance within the story's world (e.g., a place of conflict, refuge, mystery, cultural importance).\n5.  **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating facts directly, paint a picture.

For each entity, include a concise `description`.\n    *   `Person`: Individuals within the narrative.\n    *   `Organization`: Groups, factions, or institutions.\n    *   `Location`: Places where events occur.\n        *   **Location Properties:** For `Location` entities, prioritize and include *descriptive attributes* that define the setting. Essential properties include:\n            *   `name`: The explicit name of the location.\n            *   `type`: (e.g., `Natural`, `Artificial`, `Cosmic`, `Urban`, `Rural`, `Interior`, `Exterior`).\n            *   `climate`: (e.g., `temperate`, `arid`, `icy`, `tropical`, `toxic`).\n            *   `terrain`: (e.g., `mountainous`, `flat`, `forest`, `desert`, `underwater`, `urban landscape`).\n            *   `atmosphere`: (e.g., `oppressive`, `serene`, `chaotic`, `mysterious`, `technological`, `pristine`).\n            *   `dominant_features`: Key physical characteristics (e.g., `giant crystals`, `dense fog`, `advanced architecture`, `ancient ruins`).\n            *   `sensory_details`: Notable sights, sounds, smells, or tactile experiences associated with the location (e.g., `scent of ozone`, `constant hum`, `blinding sunlight`).\n            *   `era_period`: The time or historical context if discernible (e.g., `prehistoric`, `medieval`, `futuristic`, `Victorian`).\n    *   `Object`: Significant items, artifacts, or structures. Include properties like `material`, `function`, `age`, `condition`.\n    *   `Event`: Notable occurrences or actions. Include `time`, `location_ref`, `participants_ref`.\n    *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas, themes, or phenomena relevant to the setting (e.g., `magic system`, `societal norms`, `technological advancement`).\n    *   `EnvironmentalPhenomenon`: Specific atmospheric or geological conditions (e.g., `acid rain`, `sandstorm`, `zero-gravity`, `aurora`).\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Extract relationships between entities. For each relationship, include:\n    *   `source_entity_id`\n    *   `target_entity_id`\n    *   `type`: (e.g., `located_in`, `inhabited_by`, `associated_with`, `part_of`, `influences`, `experiences`, `created_by`, `depicts`).\n    *   `setting_relevance`: A numerical score (1-5) indicating how strongly this relationship defines or describes the setting or atmosphere. Higher scores indicate greater importance for setting description.\n    *   `description`: A brief natural language description of the relationship.\n\n**Prioritization:**\n\n*   Focus on extracting entities and relationships that directly contribute to understanding the *environment*, *atmosphere*, and *sensory experience* of the story's world.\n*   For `Location` entities, prioritize descriptive properties over functional ones.\n*   Favor relationships with high `setting_relevance`.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nProvide the extracted information as a list of JSON objects, each representing either an entity or a relationship.

      "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 100 tokens appears suboptimal for the GraphRAG system's objective of describing settings. Here's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (100 tokens):**\n\n1.  **Insufficient Context for Entity Resolution and Relationship Extraction:** A chunk size of 100 tokens is likely too small to capture enough semantic context for meaningful entity and relationship extraction.\n    *   **Entity Disambiguation:** Key entities (people, places, objects) might be split across chunks, making it difficult for the LLM to understand their full identity or role. For instance, a location mentioned at the end of one chunk and its description at the beginning of the next would be disconnected.\n    *   **Relationship Granularity:** Relationships between entities are often established through surrounding text. Small chunks might only contain a fraction of a sentence describing a relationship, leading to weak or missed connections. This directly impacts the \"spatial cohesion\" critique, as adjacency and hierarchical relationships between locations are harder to infer.\n\n2.  **Fragmented World-Building Information:** When chunking at 100 tokens, information relevant to a single location or a localized setting might be scattered across multiple chunks.\n    *   **Loss of Local Detail:** Descriptions of a specific place (e.g., the atmosphere, terrain, flora) could be broken down, preventing the formation of a rich, cohesive mental image within a single chunk. This exacerbates the \"limited environmental detail\" issue.\n    *   **Character-Centric Bias Amplification:** If character actions or dialogue dominate small chunks, descriptive elements of the setting might be further marginalized or lost entirely during graph construction, reinforcing the over-reliance on character-centric summaries.\n\n3.  **Challenges for Community Detection and Summarization:**\n    *   **Weak Community Cohesion:** If chunks are too small, the resulting graph might have many poorly connected nodes. This could lead to the formation of numerous small, fragmented communities that don't represent coherent geographical regions or thematic clusters, making the \"insufficient world-building hierarchy\" problem worse.\n    *   **Superficial Summaries:** Summarizing very small chunks, or chunks that only contain partial information about a location, will naturally lead to shallow and less informative summaries, as identified in the critique. The LLM has less context to work with.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nA larger chunk size, perhaps in the range of 250-500 tokens, would likely be more beneficial. This would:\n\n*   **Increase Context:** Allow for more complete sentences and paragraphs within each chunk, improving entity and relationship extraction quality.\n*   **Preserve Local Descriptions:** Keep descriptive details about settings and their connections within a single chunk, facilitating richer summaries and better spatial understanding.\n*   **Support Hierarchical Structures:** Provide a better foundation for identifying and representing broader geographical concepts and their constituent parts, addressing the hierarchy critique.\n\nWhile very large chunks can also introduce noise, 100 tokens appears to be on the overly fragmented side for constructing a detailed world-building graph.",
      "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The provided prompt for graph construction has several shortcomings that likely contribute to the identified issues in community selection and retrieval relevance, especially for a query like \"Describe the setting of the story.\"\n\nHere's a critique focused on improving the prompt for better graph construction:\n\n**Critique of the Graph Construction Prompt:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Granularity in Entity/Relationship Extraction for \"Setting\":** The prompt asks for general entity types (Person, Organization, Location, etc.) and relationships. However, for setting-related queries, it doesn't explicitly encourage the extraction of *descriptive properties* that define a setting. For example, a \"Location\" entity might have properties like \"climate,\" \"terrain,\" \"atmosphere,\" or \"dominant flora/fauna,\" which are crucial for setting description but aren't explicitly requested beyond a generic \"description\" field. Similarly, relationships could be more nuanced, describing *how* entities interact with the environment rather than just *that* they are related.\n\n2.  **Oversimplified Entity Typing:** While broad types are useful, a more detailed categorization could benefit setting analysis. For instance, distinguishing between \"Natural Location\" (e.g., planet, forest) and \"Artificial Location\" (e.g., city, spaceship interior) or categorizing environments (e.g., \"Atmospheric Condition,\" \"Terrain Type\") could allow the downstream agent to make more informed selections.\n\n3.  **No Emphasis on Contextual Importance:** The prompt asks for *all* relationships among *extracted* entities. This can lead to a graph dense with trivial or incidental relationships, especially when trying to focus on the setting. There's no instruction to prioritize relationships that *define the environment* or *contribute significantly to the atmosphere* of a scene. For instance, a relationship \"Person X visits Location Y\" is less informative for setting than \"Location Y has a harsh, icy climate.\"\n\n4.  **Implicit vs. Explicit Setting Elements:** The prompt relies on entities being explicitly typed as \"Location\" and their properties to convey setting. However, setting is also built through descriptions of objects, events, and even character perceptions that aren't directly \"Locations.\" For example, a \"strange object\" in a \"room\" might contribute to the setting's mood. The prompt doesn't guide the extraction of these more subtle setting elements or their properties.\n\n5.  **Limited Scope of \"Properties\":** The example properties (age, role, description) are generic. For setting, properties should be more specific and descriptive of the environment. The prompt should encourage capturing sensory details, scale, geological features, weather patterns, or the technological level of a location.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Enhanced Entity Properties for Setting:** Modify the prompt to explicitly ask for setting-specific properties for Location entities, such as: `climate`, `terrain`, `atmosphere`, `dominant features`, `sensory details`, `architectural style`, `era/time period`.\n2.  **Attribute Relationships to Setting Contribution:** For relationships, add a field like `setting_relevance` or `descriptive_value` that indicates how strongly the relationship contributes to defining the environment or atmosphere.\n3.  **Encourage \"Atmospheric\" Entities:** Prompt the extraction of entities that describe abstract environmental qualities, such as `WeatherPhenomenon`, `AtmosphericCondition`, `LightLevel`, `Soundscape`.\n4.  **Prioritize Descriptive Over Functional:** When extracting properties and relationships, implicitly or explicitly guide the model to favor descriptive details that build a sense of place over purely functional or plot-driven information.\n\nBy making these adjustments, the graph construction process can yield a knowledge graph that is richer in setting-specific details, allowing the community detection and retrieval agent to perform much more effectively for queries focused on the story's world.",

However, the selection exhibits several critical flaws, leading to fragmented and insufficient information about the world.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Cohesion and Interconnection:** The primary issue is the disparate nature of the selected communities (4, 5, 7, 8, 9). While they each mention locations (Island, Valleys, Jungle, Inlet, Domain), there's no information connecting these places. The system fails to provide a holistic view of the world. For instance, it's unclear if the \"Island of Ancestry\" (Community 4) is the same as the \"Island Domain\" (Community 9), or if the \"Jungle of Sekk\" (Community 7) is part of the \"Twelve Valleys\" (Community 5). This fragmentation prevents the LLM from constructing a coherent mental map of the setting.\n\n2.  **Insufficient Environmental Detail:** The summaries, while mentioning places, tend to focus heavily on character actions, plot points, and conflicts happening *within* those places. For example, Community 4 mentions \"Manak\" and \"Konto,\" but the description emphasizes Rold's journey and themes of slavery. The actual characteristics of these locations – their terrain, climate, atmosphere, or unique features – are largely absent. Similarly, Community 8 focuses on a \"grassy inlet\" but lacks broader context. The query \"Describe the setting\" requires information *about* the environment itself, not just where characters act.\n\n3.  **Over-Reliance on Character-Centric Summaries:** The communities selected are often summarized around character narratives (e.g., Dietrich's journey, Tholon Sarna's ordeal). While these characters inhabit the setting, their stories do not *describe* the setting. The agent should prioritize communities whose core information pertains to geographical features, biomes, settlements, and their relationships, rather than character motivations or conflicts.\n\n4.  **Absence of Hierarchical or Macro-Level Setting Information:** The agent selected multiple specific, somewhat disconnected locations. It failed to identify or prioritize any community that might describe a larger geographical entity (e.g., a continent, a region containing multiple valleys, or a dominant biome) from which these smaller locations could be understood as part. This prevents the LLM from grasping the scale and structure of the story's world.\n\n**In summary:** The current selection process prioritizes the mere mention of locations over the descriptive richness and interconnectedness needed to actually \"describe the setting.\" It provides a collection of disparate geographical points without building a unified or detailed picture of the world.",
      "answer_generation_critique": "Critique of Previous Answer Generation Prompt:\n\nThe previous prompt was effective at setting a high-level goal for the LLM (generate rich, coherent, atmospheric descriptions) and provided good general instructions (synthesize, focus on relevance, evoke atmosphere, establish coherence, prioritize key elements, direct answer). However, the generated answer's low ROUGE score indicates a significant disconnect between these instructions and the LLM's execution, particularly in **synthesizing and weaving details into a cohesive narrative** and **evoking atmosphere and sensory details**.\n\n**Key Issues & Prompt Improvement Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Specificity on \"Coherence and Structure\":** The feedback highlighted that the answer read like a list and lacked flow. The instruction \"Group similar locations or environmental features. Explain how different aspects of the setting relate to each other and contribute to the overall world-building\" was too abstract.\n\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Add more concrete guidance on *how* to achieve coherence. For example:\n        *   \"Organize your description logically. Consider starting with a broad overview of the world and then zooming into specific regions, or grouping locations by type (e.g., cities, natural landscapes, specific landmarks).\"\n        *   \"Use transitional phrases to seamlessly connect different locations and elements, showing their spatial or thematic relationships (e.g., 'Adjacent to this, lies...', 'Further inland, one finds...', 'These regions are connected by...').\"\n\n2.  **Insufficient Emphasis on \"Atmosphere and Sensory Details\":** The prompt mentioned \"Evoke Atmosphere and Sensory Details\" but didn't provide explicit examples or strong cues for *extracting* these from the input. The answer was factual rather than evocative.\n\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Strengthen this instruction with more actionable guidance:\n        *   \"Actively seek out descriptive adjectives, adverbs, and phrases in the retrieved information that convey mood, tone, and sensory experiences (visuals, sounds, smells, feelings). Integrate these directly into your description.\"\n        *   \"Instead of merely stating a location exists, describe its *quality* and *impact* on the characters or narrative. For example, if a jungle is mentioned, describe if it's 'lush and vibrant,' 'foreboding and dense,' or 'scorching and arid'.\"\n\n3.  **Vagueness on \"Narrative Relevance\" and \"Key Elements\":** While the prompt asked to prioritize narrative relevance, the LLM included many details without clearly establishing their importance or connection to the overall setting.\n\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Refine these instructions to encourage a more focused output:\n        *   \"Focus on details that define the *primary environments* and *significant locations* that are repeatedly mentioned or are central to character actions and plot developments. Filter out minor details that do not contribute to the overall impression of the world.\"\n        *   \"For each significant location, explain its role or significance within the story's world (e.g., a place of conflict, refuge, mystery, cultural importance).\"\n\n4.  **Lack of \"Show, Don't Tell\" Guidance:** The answer \"told\" about the setting (e.g., \"Konto serves as a nexus\") rather than \"showing\" it through description.\n\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Incorporate a \"show, don't tell\" principle:\n        *   \"Instead of stating facts, paint a picture. For example, instead of saying 'Manak is a place of slavery,' describe elements that *imply* or *demonstrate* slavery within the setting's context, if possible, or frame it as 'a land marked by the visible presence of widespread slavery'.\" (Note: This is dependent on the retrieved info quality).\n\nBy making these prompt modifications, the LLM will receive more explicit instructions on how to structure, describe, and prioritize information, leading to a more cohesive, atmospheric, and relevant answer that better reflects the intent of the RAG system.",
