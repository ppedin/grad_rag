    "evaluation_feedback": "The ROUGE score of 0.0345 is extremely low, indicating that the generated response has very little overlap with what would be considered a good answer to the query.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why the response is weak and how it can be improved:\n\n**Weaknesses of the Current Response:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Depth and Nuance:** The response identifies \"enslavement\" with \"Tholon Sarna's captivity in a prison pit.\" While this might be *an* instance of enslavement in the story, it's presented as the *only* representation and lacks any discussion of its broader significance. The query asks about the \"significance,\" which implies a need to explore the themes, impact, and meaning of enslavement within the narrative, not just identify a single plot point.\n2.  **Limited Scope:** The response focuses solely on \"Tholon Sarna's captivity.\" If enslavement is a significant theme, it's likely to manifest in other ways or affect other characters, or have broader societal implications within the story's world. The response doesn't explore these possibilities.\n3.  **Vagueness:** \"Central element of Community 6\" is also vague. What *is* Community 6? How does this element make it central? What does this captivity *represent* thematically or symbolically?\n4.  **Ignores the \"Significance\" Aspect:** The core of the query is \"significance.\" The response simply *identifies* an event related to enslavement but doesn't explain *why* it's important, what it reveals about the characters, the society, or the story's message.\n\n**How to Improve the Response:**\n\nTo significantly improve the response, the RAG system needs to access and synthesize information that addresses the *significance* of enslavement, not just its presence. This would involve looking for:\n\n1.  **Thematic Exploration:** Does enslavement represent power dynamics, oppression, loss of freedom, dehumanization, resilience, or rebellion in the story?\n2.  **Character Development:** How does enslavement (or the threat/experience of it) shape the motivations, actions, and growth of characters like Tholon Sarna or others?\n3.  **Societal Context:** Is enslavement a pervasive institution in the story's world? What are its social, economic, or political implications?\n4.  **Symbolism:** Does enslavement symbolize something larger, such as the loss of identity, the struggle for liberation, or the consequences of unchecked power?\n5.  **Plot Impact:** Beyond a single character's captivity, how does enslavement drive the plot forward or create conflict?\n\n**Specific Improvement Strategies for the RAG System:**\n\n1.  **Expand Retrieval Scope:**\n    *   Instead of just retrieving sentences containing \"enslavement\" or \"captivity,\" the system should retrieve passages that discuss **themes related to freedom, oppression, power, and agency**.\n    *   Look for character arcs that involve overcoming or being defined by enslaved status.\n    *   Identify descriptions of the social structure or history of the world that mention or allude to enslavement.\n\n2.  **Improve Information Synthesis:**\n    *   **Identify multiple instances/representations:** If enslavement appears in different forms or affects multiple characters, the system should synthesize this information.\n    *   **Connect events to themes:** The system needs to go beyond stating *what* happened and explain *why it matters*. For instance, linking Tholon's captivity to themes of resistance or the injustice of the ruling class.\n    *   **Articulate the 'why':** The response should answer \"why is enslavement significant?\" by explaining its thematic, character-driving, or plot-advancing functions.\n\n3.  **Refine Prompt Engineering (if applicable):**\n    *   The original query is good. However, if the RAG system is struggling, one might experiment with slightly more specific prompts for retrieval, e.g., \"What are the thematic implications of enslavement in the story?\" or \"How does the story portray the impact of enslavement on characters and society?\"\n\n**Example of an Improved Response (Hypothetical, based on potential RAG retrieval):**\n\n\"Enslavement in the story is a profound and multifaceted theme, extending beyond Tholon Sarna's literal captivity in a prison pit within Community 6. This experience highlights the brutal subjugation and dehumanization inherent in the society's power structures. Tholon's struggle for survival and eventual defiance against his captors serve as a potent symbol of resistance and the enduring human will for freedom. Furthermore, the narrative explores the psychological toll of enslavement on individuals and its corrosive effect on societal ethics, questioning the legitimacy of systems built on the oppression of others. The concept of enslavement thus underscores the story's core messages about liberation, justice, and the fight against tyranny.\"\n\n**In summary, the ROUGE score reflects a critical failure to address the core of the query. The response needs to move from simple identification of an event to a thematic and analytical discussion of enslavement's significance within the broader narrative.**",

Your goal is to guide the selection of hyperparameters for graph construction, prioritizing the creation of rich, nuanced, and contextually accurate knowledge graphs.\n\n**Critique of Current Approach:** The fixed chunk size of 200 tokens has been identified as a significant limitation. This arbitrary granularity can lead to:\n1.  **Contextual Fragmentation:** Essential information for defining entities and relationships may be split across chunks, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate graph structures.\n2.  **Noisy or Diluted Graphs:** Conversely, overly large chunks can group disparate information, obscuring meaningful connections and leading to superficial community detection (e.g., mistaking \"captivity\" for \"enslavement\").\n3.  **Limited Richness:** The inability to adapt to varying textual complexity hinders the capture of deeper entity types, complex relationship types, and crucial societal context.\n\n**Your Task:** Based on this critique, you will now provide a rationale for selecting an optimal chunking strategy for graph construction. Instead of a fixed size, prioritize strategies that ensure contextual completeness and semantic coherence.\n\n**Prompting for Chunk Size Optimization:**\n\nWhen asked to determine or recommend a chunk size, provide a detailed justification that considers the following:\n\n1.  **Semantic Cohesion:** Advocate for chunking based on natural linguistic boundaries (sentences, paragraphs, or thematic units) over fixed token counts. Explain how this preserves the integrity of concepts and relationships.\n2.  **Contextual Completeness:** Emphasize that a chunk should contain sufficient information to define a key entity, relationship, or concept without being so large that it dilutes specific details. For example, if discussing \"enslavement,\" ensure that the chunk captures its systemic and societal aspects, not just individual instances.\n3.  **Entity/Relationship Density:** Discuss how the density of entities and the complexity of their interrelationships within a given text segment should influence chunking. Prioritize keeping closely related information together.\n4.  **Graph Richness Objective:** Frame the chunking decision in terms of its impact on the graph's ability to represent rich entity types, diverse relationship types, and nuanced societal context, directly addressing the identified critique.\n5.  **Adaptive Strategy:** If possible, suggest an adaptive or dynamic chunking approach that can adjust based on the content's complexity and narrative flow.\n\n**Example Output Structure (when asked about chunk size):**\n\n\"Based on the critical need for richer graph representations and the limitations of fixed-size chunking, I recommend an adaptive strategy. Rather than a fixed 200 tokens, we should prioritize chunking by [sentence/paragraph/semantic unit]. This approach ensures that [explain how it preserves context, e.g., 'the full legal and social context of enslavement remains within a single chunk, preventing fragmentation']. This will directly improve the graph's ability to capture [mention specific improvements, e.g., 'nuanced relationship types like 'economic exploitation' and societal context beyond mere 'captivity'], leading to more accurate community summarization and deeper insights. If a semantic unit exceeds a reasonable token limit (e.g., 500 tokens), consider a controlled split based on a clear logical break, but always prioritizing the integrity of core concepts.\"",

      "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 200 tokens, while seemingly arbitrary, can significantly impact the GraphRAG system's effectiveness, particularly given the critique of the generated graph and retrieval process.\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (200 tokens):**\n\n*   **Potential for Oversharing or Undersharing of Context:** A fixed chunk size of 200 tokens might be too large or too small depending on the narrative density and the specific entities and relationships within that segment of text.\n    *   **Too Large:** If a 200-token chunk contains multiple distinct events or concepts, the graph extraction might become noisy. This could lead to entities and relationships being grouped into a single node or community that are not truly related, diluting the focus and potentially masking important nuances. The critique highlights a lack of depth in community summarization; a larger chunk could exacerbate this by forcing disparate information into one community. For example, if a 200-token chunk describes a character's enslavement *and* a separate, unrelated plot point, the graph might incorrectly link these.\n    *   **Too Small:** Conversely, if 200 tokens is too granular, essential context for understanding complex concepts like \"enslavement\" might be split across multiple chunks. This would result in fragmented entities and relationships in the graph. The critique points out the need for richer relationship types and societal context. If the details defining \"enslavement\" (e.g., ownership, forced labor, legal status) are spread across several small chunks, the graph extraction might fail to connect them into a cohesive representation of this concept. The community detection might then only identify \"captivity\" because the fuller picture of \"enslavement\" is not present in any single chunk.\n\n*   **Impact on Graph Richness and Nuance:** The critique strongly emphasizes the need for richer entity types and relationship types, and for capturing societal context. A fixed chunk size struggles to adapt to the varying complexity of textual content. If the text describing the societal structures or the specifics of enslavement is more than 200 tokens, it will be split, hindering the graph's ability to represent these complex ideas comprehensively. This directly relates to the identified gap in representing \"enslavement\" as a systemic concept rather than just personal \"captivity.\"\n\n*   **Suboptimal Community Detection and Summarization:** The critique notes that community detection identified \"captivity\" as a proxy for \"enslavement,\" indicating a superficial understanding. A fixed chunk size may not align with the natural thematic boundaries of the narrative. If a 200-token chunk cuts off a crucial part of a thematic discussion, the community detection might produce less meaningful clusters. Similarly, summaries might lack depth because the underlying graph representation, influenced by chunking, lacks the necessary interconnectedness and detail.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nThe system would benefit from a **dynamic or adaptive chunking strategy**. Instead of a fixed 200 tokens, the chunking should ideally consider:\n\n1.  **Semantic Boundaries:** Chunking based on sentences, paragraphs, or even larger thematic units identified by an NLP model.\n2.  **Entity and Relationship Density:** Potentially adjusting chunk size to keep related entities and their defining relationships within the same chunk, especially for complex concepts like \"enslavement.\"\n3.  **Contextual Completeness:** Ensuring that a chunk contains sufficient information to define a concept or event meaningfully, without being excessively large to cause noise.\n\nThis adaptive approach would allow the graph construction to better capture the nuances and richness of the text, directly addressing the shortcomings identified in the critique regarding the representation of \"enslavement,\" relationship depth, and societal context.",
      "graph_builder_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the graph construction prompt, focusing on areas for improvement:\n\nThe current prompt is too general and lacks specificity for building a rich and informative knowledge graph, particularly for complex or nuanced concepts like \"enslavement.\"\n\n**Key Issues with the Prompt:**\n\n1.  **Vague Entity Types:** The prompt offers broad entity types like \"Person,\" \"Organization,\" and \"Concept.\" While a starting point, it doesn't encourage the identification of specific, hierarchical, or role-based entities crucial for detailed analysis. For instance, instead of just \"Concept,\" specific concepts like \"Enslavement,\" \"Slavery,\" \"Bondage,\" \"Freedom,\" \"Power Dynamics,\" or \"Social Hierarchy\" should be encouraged. The absence of a prompt to identify specific roles (e.g., \"Slave,\" \"Owner,\" \"Rebel\") hinders the graph's ability to represent social structures.\n\n2.  **Insufficient Relationship Granularity:** The prompt asks for \"type,\" \"description,\" and \"evidence\" for relationships. This is a good foundation, but it doesn't push for *specific, actionable* relationship types that capture the essence of complex interactions. For example, the prompt doesn't explicitly guide the model to identify relationships like `is_enslaved_by`, `owns`, `forced_labor_for`, `exploited_by`, `practices_slavery`, or `struggles_for_freedom`. This vagueness is why \"captivity\" might be extracted as a generic relationship, missing the critical distinction of systemic enslavement.\n\n3.  **Lack of Contextual and Societal Emphasis:** The prompt focuses on identifying entities and relationships directly from the text chunk but doesn't explicitly ask for the extraction of broader societal, economic, or political contexts. This is a major limitation when the query involves understanding the *significance* of a concept. The prompt should encourage identifying entities and relationships that describe societal structures, power imbalances, legal frameworks, or economic systems that underpin or are affected by the core concepts.\n\n4.  **No Guidance on \"Significance\" or Nuance:** The prompt doesn't instruct the LLM to look for or represent the *significance* or *nuance* of entities and relationships. The query explicitly asks for \"significance,\" but the prompt doesn't guide the graph construction towards capturing this. This leads to shallow representations where related but not identical concepts (like \"captivity\" vs. \"enslavement\") are treated with equal weight, and the deeper implications are missed.\n\n5.  **Underexplored \"Properties\" Field:** While properties are requested, the examples (\"age, role, description\") are very generic. The prompt could encourage more specific properties relevant to the entity type, especially for concepts like \"Enslavement\" (e.g., \"economic impact,\" \"legal status,\" \"historical precedent,\" \"societal acceptance\").\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n*   **Encourage Hierarchical and Specific Entity Types:** Prompt for more granular entity types, especially for abstract concepts and social roles (e.g., \"Enslavement,\" \"Social Hierarchy,\" \"Owner,\" \"Slave\").\n*   **Mandate Specific Relationship Types:** Provide a list of example relationship types relevant to complex social phenomena (e.g., `owns`, `enslaved_by`, `forced_labor_for`, `economic_exploitation`, `resistance_to`).\n*   **Explicitly Request Societal/Structural Information:** Instruct the LLM to identify entities and relationships that describe the societal, economic, and political context.\n*   **Incorporate \"Significance\" and \"Nuance\" Extraction:** Add a directive for the LLM to identify and represent the *significance* and *nuances* of entities and relationships, potentially as a property or a dedicated relationship type.\n*   **Guide Property Extraction:** Provide examples of more detailed and context-specific properties.\n\nBy making the prompt more prescriptive about the *types* and *granularity* of entities, relationships, and contextual information to extract, the resulting knowledge graph will be far more capable of answering complex queries about significance and nuance.",

The agent correctly identifies \"captivity\" as a proxy for \"enslavement,\" but fails to assess the *quality* or *relevance* of the *content* within the community beyond this keyword. The community summary focuses on the immediate peril and supernatural elements, not the systemic or narrative significance of enslavement.\n\n2.  **Insufficient Consideration of \"Significance\":** The prompt doesn't adequately guide the agent to prioritize communities that explain the *significance* or *impact* of enslavement. The agent selects a community that *mentions* a related concept, rather than one that *explains* its importance in the story's context, themes, or character development.\n\n3.  **Lack of Nuance in Relevance Assessment:** The prompt should encourage the agent to consider multiple facets of a query. Enslavement's significance might be explored through power dynamics, societal structures, or character motivations for freedom, none of which were explicitly sought or found by the agent’s current approach.\n\n4.  **Limited Scope of Retrieval:** The selection of only one community, even if it contains a keyword, is insufficient for a multifaceted topic like \"significance.\" The prompt should encourage the agent to identify a *cluster* of communities that, when combined, offer a comprehensive view.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Emphasize Thematic Depth:** Modify the prompt to explicitly instruct the agent to look for communities that discuss the *implications*, *consequences*, *societal roles*, or *character motivations* related to enslavement, not just the presence of the word or its synonyms.\n2.  **Encourage Multifaceted Retrieval:** Add instructions that prompt the agent to consider selecting multiple communities if the topic is complex, aiming for diverse perspectives that collectively address the query's \"significance.\" For example: \"Consider how different communities might shed light on the *causes*, *effects*, or *themes* surrounding enslavement.\"\n3.  **Define Relevance Beyond Keywords:** Guide the agent to prioritize communities whose summaries suggest a deeper exploration of the query's core concepts. Explicitly state that summaries focusing on plot points without thematic exploration are less valuable for answering \"significance\" questions.\n4.  **Contextualize \"Enslavement\":** The prompt could provide a brief contextual definition or examples of what \"significance of enslavement\" might entail (e.g., as a source of conflict, character motivation, societal commentary).\n\nBy refining the prompt to guide the agent towards thematic understanding and multifaceted retrieval, the system can achieve more accurate and comprehensive community selection for complex queries.",
