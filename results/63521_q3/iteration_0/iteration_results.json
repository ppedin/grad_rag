    "evaluation_feedback": "Here's an evaluation of the RAG response and suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe response provides a decent amount of information about Gurn, directly addressing the query. It successfully extracts key details about his identity, relationships, and actions from the provided context. However, it suffers from a few issues that hinder its clarity and conciseness.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Directly Answers the Query:** The response clearly states Gurn's primary role as the leader of the Vasads.\n*   **Extracts Multiple Facets:** It pulls out various aspects of Gurn's character and involvement (renegade, exile, involvement in trapping, familial ties, interactions).\n*   **Uses Information from the Context:** All the information presented appears to be derived from the underlying documents.\n\n**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Prioritization and Structure:** The information is presented as a list of facts without a clear hierarchy or flow. Some pieces of information are more central to his \"role\" than others.\n2.  **Repetitive and Slightly Confusing Phrasing:**\n    *   \"Gurn is the leader and chief of the Vasads, a group described as his loyal followers.\" - This is good.\n    *   \"He is also called a renegade and an exile from the city of Grath.\" - This describes his status, which is relevant to his role.\n    *   \"He was involved in trapping the Misty Ones.\" - This is an action.\n    *   \"Gurn has familial connections to Tholon Sarna, who recognizes him as her brother.\" - Relationship.\n    *   \"Sarna, identified as his father's woman, claims to know why Gurn is considered a traitor.\" - This is convoluted. \"Father's woman\" is an unusual and potentially unclear descriptor. The fact that Sarna knows *why* he's a traitor is important, but the phrasing could be smoother.\n    *   \"Captain Dietrich communicates with Gurn, revealing his new identity.\" - This implies a significant plot point, but \"revealing his new identity\" is vague without further context on what that new identity is.\n    *   \"Gurn also speaks to the dying Von Mark.\" - Action.\n    *   \"Noork considers Gurn his friend, wants to live in peace with him, and has received a bow from him.\" - Relationship and interaction.\n    *   \"Noork also believes the priests of Uzdon would have trapped Gurn.\" - This is more about Noork's beliefs *about* Gurn's fate, rather than Gurn's direct role.\n    *   \"A girl inquires about Gurn's appearance and possessions.\" - Minor interaction.\n3.  **Inclusion of Less Relevant Details:** Some details, like a girl inquiring about his appearance or Noork receiving a bow, are less critical to understanding Gurn's *role* in the story compared to his leadership or status as a traitor.\n4.  **Ambiguity:** Phrases like \"revealing his new identity\" are left hanging without explanation. The descriptor \"father's woman\" is unclear.\n\n**Specific Improvement Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Start with the Primary Role and then Elaborate:**\n    *   Begin with his most defining role.\n    *   Group related information together (e.g., his status as renegade/exile and why, his leadership and his followers).\n\n2.  **Clarify Confusing Phrasing:**\n    *   Rephrase \"Sarna, identified as his father's woman\" to something clearer, like \"Tholon Sarna, who claims to be his father's consort/partner\" or \"Tholon Sarna, who knows Gurn as her brother and claims to understand why he is considered a traitor.\" The exact relationship needs to be precise.\n    *   If \"new identity\" is important, and the context provides it, include it. If not, it's better to omit or rephrase, e.g., \"Captain Dietrich communicates with Gurn, suggesting a shift in his circumstances or allegiances.\"\n\n3.  **Prioritize Information:**\n    *   Focus on his leadership, his status as an exile/renegade, his involvement in key events (trapping Misty Ones), and his significant relationships that define his character or plot.\n    *   Omit or downplay minor interactions or peripheral details if they don't significantly contribute to his overall role.\n\n4.  **Ensure Cohesion:** Use transition words and phrases to connect ideas smoothly.\n\n**Revised Response Example (incorporating suggestions):**\n\nHere are a few options for improvement, depending on the desired level of detail and conciseness:\n\n**Option 1 (More Concise):**\n\n> Gurn is primarily known as",

      "learned_prompt_graph_retrieval_planner": "You are an expert AI assistant guiding a GraphRAG system's retrieval process. Your goal is to generate efficient and strategic retrieval plans for exploring a knowledge graph.\n\n**Core Principles for Retrieval Planning:**\n\n1.  **Avoid Redundant Exploration:** Once a node or concept has been identified and its immediate connections explored, do not repeat broad keyword searches for the same entity. Instead, leverage `get_neighbors` on already discovered nodes or use more specific relationship-based searches. Track explored nodes and relationships to prevent revisits.\n\n2.  **Strategic Depth and Graph Traversal:** Prioritize deepening exploration from promising discoveries. If a relationship (e.g., \"leader of\") yields relevant information, continue exploring along that path or related paths before resorting to broader searches. Consider multi-hop traversals when direct neighbors don't fully address the query or when higher-level context is needed.\n\n3.  **Progressive and Iterative Refinement:** Each retrieval step should build upon the previous one. Use the information gathered in earlier iterations to inform and refine subsequent searches. Avoid returning to broad, unfocused searches if specific paths have already been identified. If a search yields results, the next iteration should analyze those results to decide whether to explore their neighbors, specific relationships, or a different, related concept.\n\n4.  **Leverage Advanced Graph Analysis:** Utilize functions like `identify_communities` or `analyze_path` when understanding broader context, influence, or complex relationships is necessary, rather than relying solely on node-by-node exploration.\n\n**Function Usage Guidelines:**\n\n*   `search_nodes_by_keyword(keyword)`: Use initially to discover core entities. Subsequent uses for the *same* keyword should be avoided unless the goal is to find *new* information not previously identified or if the query explicitly demands it after a significant shift in understanding.\n*   `get_neighbors(node_id)`: Primary function for exploring direct connections after a node is identified.\n*   `get_relationships(node_id, relationship_type)`: Use for targeted exploration along specific relationship types.\n*   `get_node_details(node_id)`: Use to retrieve specific attributes or descriptions of a node.\n*   `identify_communities(graph)`: Use to understand group structures or central entities within the graph.\n*   `analyze_path(start_node_id, end_node_id, max_depth)`: Use to find connections or",

      "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 100 tokens appears to be a contributing factor to the identified issues in the graph.\n\n**1. Granularity and Specificity:**\n\n*   **Overly Broad Chunks:** A chunk size of 100 tokens might be too large, encompassing too much disparate information. This can lead to the LLM extracting generic relationships like \"associated with\" or \"attacks\" because the specific context for more precise relationships (e.g., \"leader of,\" \"physically attacks\") is diluted within a larger chunk. The LLM might struggle to discern finer-grained connections when presented with such broad segments of text.\n*   **Loss of Nuance:** Smaller chunks would allow for more focused extraction of entities and their precise relationships. For instance, if a sentence describes a character *giving* an order to another, a smaller chunk might isolate this interaction, leading to a \"gives order to\" relationship. In a 100-token chunk, this could be buried amongst other events, resulting in a less informative \"interacts with\" or \"associated with\" relationship.\n\n**2. Graph Structure and Connectivity:**\n\n*   **Potential for Noisy Relationships:** Larger chunks increase the likelihood of including irrelevant information or multiple distinct events/interactions. This noise can lead to the creation of spurious or overly general relationships, contributing to the high number of \"associated with\" and \"attacks\" relationships. A smaller chunk size would naturally lead to more focused, and potentially more numerous, but also more semantically accurate, relationships.\n*   **Contradictory Density Description:** While not solely attributable to chunk size, larger chunks might contribute to a less precise representation of connectivity. If a chunk contains multiple entities and a few relationships, and this is repeated across many chunks, it could inadvertently create a denser graph than intended, especially if LLMs are prone to inferring connections when given larger contexts.\n\n**3. Data Quality and Consistency:**\n\n*   **Inconsistent Aggregation:** The repeated relationship types with different counts (e.g., \"associated with\") strongly suggest issues with how relationships are identified and aggregated across chunks. A larger chunk size could exacerbate this. If a single 100-token chunk contains two instances of a character being \"associated with\" different things, and another chunk also contains \"associated with\" instances, the aggregation process might struggle to differentiate them, leading to duplicated or ambiguously counted relationships. Smaller chunks would likely result in more distinct relationship instances, simplifying aggregation",
      "graph_builder_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the graph construction prompt and resulting graph, focusing on improvements for a GraphRAG system:\n\n**Critique of Graph Construction Prompt & Resulting Graph:**\n\n1.  **Overly Generic Entity/Relationship Extraction:**\n    *   **Issue:** The prompt requests \"entities\" and \"relationships\" but lacks specific instructions for *what kind* of entities and relationships are most valuable for a RAG system. This leads to the observed abundance of generic relationship types like \"associated with\" (appears multiple times with different counts) and broad entity types like \"Concept\" and \"Object.\"\n    *   **Impact:** These generic labels create noise and reduce the precision of graph exploration. The LLM agent has to sift through many irrelevant or vague connections to find meaningful information. For instance, \"associated with\" doesn't tell the agent *how* entities are associated (e.g., is it a cause, an effect, a possession, a collaboration?).\n    *   **Suggestion:** The prompt should guide the LLM to identify *semantically rich* entities and relationships relevant to narrative or factual extraction. For relationships, it should encourage more specific types like \"causes,\" \"enables,\" \"located in,\" \"protagonist of,\" \"conflict with,\" \"developed by,\" \"discovered during,\" etc. For entities, it should encourage sub-typing where appropriate (e.g., distinguishing between a \"scientific concept\" and a \"narrative theme\").\n\n2.  **Lack of Explicit Role/Function Specification:**\n    *   **Issue:** The prompt asks for entity properties but doesn't emphasize identifying the *role* or *function* of entities within the text.\n    *   **Impact:** Knowing a person is a \"character\" is less useful than knowing they are the \"protagonist,\" \"antagonist,\" or \"mentor.\" Similarly, knowing an \"Object\" is a \"weapon\" is better than just \"object.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Add explicit instructions to identify and capture the functional role or significance of entities. For example: \"For each entity, also identify its role or function within the context of the text (e.g., protagonist, antagonist, McGuffin, scientific theory, historical event).\"\n\n3.  **Inconsistent Aggregation/Counting:**\n    *   **Issue:** The graph description shows duplicated relationship types with different counts (e.g., \"associated with\" appears with counts 8 and 3). This indicates an issue",
      "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The retrieval plan exhibits a significant issue with **redundant exploration**, particularly in the repeated use of `search_nodes_by_keyword('Gurn')`. After the initial discovery of the 'Gurn' node, subsequent plans should leverage `get_neighbors` or more specific relationship searches rather than re-querying the same keyword. Iterations 2 and 5 are also problematic as they both aim to explore Gurn's connections without a clear strategic difference, suggesting a lack of progress tracking.\n\nThe plan also suffers from **lack of strategic depth and missed opportunities for graph traversal**. For example, after identifying neighbors in Iteration 2, the plan doesn't prioritize digging deeper into specific, promising relationships (e.g., exploring the \"leader of\" relation with Vasads further). Instead, it resorts to broader searches or revisiting similar exploration. There's also no apparent strategy to explore beyond direct neighbors (e.g., two-hop connections) or to utilize functions like `identify_communities` or `analyze_path` to understand Gurn's position or influence in the broader graph.\n\nFinally, the **iteration logic is suboptimal**. Iteration 4's decision to search for 'Gurn' again after already exploring its neighbors indicates a failure to consolidate information and use it to guide the next step. The system should aim to expand outwards from discovered information rather than revisiting already covered ground without a new hypothesis. The plan would benefit from explicitly tracking explored nodes/relationships and using that to inform the next, more targeted step.",
      "answer_generation_critique": "The provided example highlights several weaknesses in the current prompt's ability to elicit a well-structured and focused answer. The core issue is that the prompt is too general and doesn't guide the LLM to synthesize information effectively or prioritize relevant details based on the query.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique and suggestions for prompt improvement:\n\n**1. Lack of Structure and Prioritization Guidance:**\n\n*   **Issue:** The prompt instructs the LLM to \"use the retrieved context to answer the query\" but doesn't specify *how* to structure that answer. This leads to a list-like output where important information (like leadership) is presented alongside minor details (like a girl's inquiry).\n*   **Impact:** The answer becomes unfocused and difficult to digest, failing to clearly articulate Gurn's *role*.\n*   **Prompt Improvement:** Introduce instructions for structuring the answer. For example: \"Prioritize information to clearly define the subject's primary role, then elaborate on supporting details, relationships, and key actions. Start with the most significant aspect of the role.\"\n\n**2. Insufficient Guidance on Synthesizing and Elaborating:**\n\n*   **Issue:** The prompt asks the LLM to \"exploit the retrieved information, even if incomplete,\" but doesn't encourage synthesis or explanation. The LLM simply lists extracted facts.\n*   **Impact:** Ambiguous phrases like \"father's woman\" and \"revealing his new identity\" remain unexplained because the prompt doesn't push the LLM to clarify or infer based on context, or to explicitly state what information is missing.\n*   **Prompt Improvement:** Add directives for synthesis and clarification. For example: \"Synthesize the retrieved information to provide a coherent narrative. If terms or relationships are ambiguous in the context, try to clarify them or note the ambiguity.\"\n\n**3. Lack of Focus on \"Role\":**\n\n*   **Issue:** The prompt is generic (\"answer the query\") and doesn't specifically emphasize understanding and explaining the *role* of the entity in question.\n*   **Impact:** The LLM includes information that is tangential to Gurn's role (e.g., what a girl inquired about).\n*   **Prompt Improvement:** Explicitly direct the LLM to focus on the \"role.\" For example: \"Your primary objective is to define and explain the *role* of the subject mentioned in the query.
