Your task is to provide guidance on selecting optimal hyperparameters, specifically focusing on chunk size for graph construction.\n\nWhen determining the ideal chunk size, consider the following critical factors:\n\n1.  **Information Granularity and Context Preservation:**\n    *   **Problem:** Too small a chunk size can lead to fragmentation of crucial contextual information. Essential details about entities, their motivations, actions, and relationships might be split across multiple chunks.\n    *   **Impact:** This fragmentation hinders the graph extraction LLM's ability to capture a holistic understanding, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate node/relationship extraction and a shallow graph representation.\n    *   **Guidance:** Assess if the current chunk size adequately captures complete thoughts, character arcs, or logical segments of information. A larger chunk size may be necessary to maintain semantic coherence.\n\n2.  **Graph Construction Efficiency and Complexity:**\n    *   **Problem:** Very small chunks generate a large number of individual graphs. Merging these numerous graphs can be computationally expensive, introduce noise, and lead to redundant information or connections.\n    *   **Impact:** Increased processing overhead and potentially a less clean, more error-prone graph structure.\n    *   **Guidance:** Balance the need for fine-grained extraction with the computational cost of merging many small graphs. Consider the trade-off between graph density and construction efficiency.\n\n3.  **Discourse, Narrative Flow, and Relationship Inference:**\n    *   **Problem:** Smaller chunks may lack sufficient discourse markers, narrative context, or dialogue to enable accurate inference of relationships and entity roles.\n    *   **Impact:** The graph extraction LLM might struggle to identify complex entities or nuanced relationships, leading to less semantically rich connections and a graph that doesn't fully represent the underlying knowledge.\n    *   **Guidance:** Prioritize chunk sizes that allow the LLM to grasp the sequence of events, dialogues, and overarching themes necessary for accurate relationship definition.\n\n4.  **Entity and Relationship Extraction Quality:**\n    *   **Problem:** When key information defining entities or relationships spans across chunk boundaries, extraction accuracy diminishes.\n    *   **Impact:** Leads to a graph with fewer entities, less precise relationships, or misattributed connections, directly impacting the agent's ability to perform targeted exploration and answer queries effectively.\n    *   **Guidance:** Choose a chunk size that maximizes the probability of containing all relevant",

      "learned_prompt_graph_retrieval_planner": "You are an AI assistant tasked with planning retrieval strategies for a GraphRAG system. Your goal is to efficiently and effectively gather information from a knowledge graph to answer user queries.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Stateful and Iterative Planning:** Maintain a memory of previously executed retrieval steps and their results. Avoid redundant function calls (e.g., repeatedly querying the same node's neighbors without processing the information). Each step should build upon the knowledge gained.\n2.  **Query-Driven Exploration:** Align retrieval actions directly with the intent of the user's query. Prioritize information directly relevant to answering the question.\n3.  **Strategic Function Selection:** Choose the most appropriate graph traversal or search function based on the current information need. Consider:\n    *   `get_neighbors(node_id)`: To explore direct connections of a known entity. Use judiciously, especially if neighbors have already been retrieved or analyzed.\n    *   `get_node_by_id(node_id)`: To retrieve detailed attributes of a specific node.\n    *   `search_nodes_by_keyword(keyword, label=None)`: To find nodes based on names or descriptions. Useful for initial entity discovery or when entity IDs are unknown.\n    *   `get_relationships(node_id, relationship_type=None, direction=None)`: To find specific types of connections a node has. Crucial for understanding how entities interact or are related.\n    *   `get_relationships_by_keyword(keyword, relationship_type=None, direction=None)`: To find relationships involving entities matching a keyword.\n    *   `get_nodes_with_relationship(relationship_type, target_node_id=None, source_node_id=None)`: To find nodes connected by a specific relationship.\n4.  **Information Synthesis:** After retrieving data, analyze it. If a strategy yields no results (e.g., empty graph), pivot to a different, more promising approach. Don't continue exploring unproductive paths.\n5.  **Role/Attribute Inference:** When asked about roles, attributes, or specific properties, focus on retrieving relationship types and connecting nodes that explicitly define these aspects. Prioritize relationship types like \"is a,\" \"plays role,\" \"works as,\" or relationships indicating actions and interactions that define a character's function.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nFor each step, output a JSON object containing:",

      "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 256 is likely suboptimal for this GraphRAG system due to several interconnected reasons related to information granularity and graph construction.\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (256):**\n\n1.  **Information Fragmentation:** A chunk size of 256 might be too small, leading to the fragmentation of crucial contextual information. For instance, if a single character's motivations, actions, and relationships are spread across multiple small chunks, the LLM extracting graphs from these chunks might fail to capture the complete picture. This can result in incomplete or inaccurate node/relationship extraction, as seen in the critique where Gurn's role is hard to define due to a lack of holistic understanding. Graphs built from highly fragmented data will struggle to represent complex relationships accurately.\n\n2.  **Increased Graph Complexity and Redundancy:** Splitting the text into many small chunks (256 tokens each) will inevitably lead to a larger number of individual graphs being generated. Merging these numerous smaller graphs can become computationally expensive and may introduce more noise and redundant information. The critique points to redundant exploration, which could be exacerbated if essential connections are only partially captured in separate chunks and then mistakenly re-established or explored multiple times during the merge and agent phases.\n\n3.  **Difficulty in Capturing Discourse and Narrative Flow:** Smaller chunks are less likely to contain sufficient discourse markers or narrative context to allow the graph extraction LLM to accurately infer relationships and entity types. For example, understanding a character's role often depends on the sequence of events or dialogues spanning more than 256 tokens. This can lead to a \"shallower\" graph with less semantically rich relationships, hindering the agent's ability to perform targeted exploration as noted in the critique (e.g., ineffective use of \"is a\" relationships).\n\n4.  **Suboptimal Entity and Relationship Extraction:** The LLM tasked with graph extraction might struggle to identify complex entities or nuanced relationships when presented with only a small segment of text. Key information defining roles (like Gurn's) might be split across chunk boundaries, preventing their accurate extraction. This can lead to the graph having fewer entities or less precise relationships, directly impacting the agent's ability to answer queries effectively.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nConsider increasing the chunk size. A larger chunk size (e.g., 512-1024 tokens) would allow for more complete contextual information to be processed by the graph extraction LLM, potentially leading to",
      "graph_builder_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the graph construction prompt, focusing on areas for improvement:\n\n**Critique of the Graph Construction Prompt:**\n\nThe current prompt is a good starting point but can be significantly improved for more precise and efficient graph construction, particularly in capturing nuanced relationships and entity roles.\n\n1.  **Ambiguity in Entity Typing and Property Extraction:**\n    *   The prompt asks for entity `type` (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept). While this is helpful, it could be more granular. For instance, a \"Person\" could be further specified as \"Protagonist,\" \"Antagonist,\" \"Scientist,\" etc., if deducible from the text.\n    *   The `properties` section is too broad. It asks for \"characteristics of the entity extracted from the text.\" This can lead to the extraction of trivial or irrelevant details. The prompt should guide the LLM to extract only *significant* properties that contribute to understanding the entity or its role in the narrative. For example, for a \"Person,\" focus on properties like \"Occupation,\" \"Allegiance,\" \"Key Actions,\" or \"Motivations.\"\n\n2.  **Lack of Specificity in Relationship Definition:**\n    *   The prompt requests `type`, `description`, and `evidence` for relationships. This is a strong foundation. However, the `type` of relationship could be more constrained or guided. For example, instead of a generic \"interacts with,\" encourage more specific types like \"collaborates with,\" \"opposes,\" \"leads,\" \"is subordinate to,\" \"created,\" \"destroyed,\" etc., based on common narrative structures.\n    *   The `description` field is crucial but highly dependent on the LLM's interpretation. It might be beneficial to ask for a more structured description, perhaps focusing on *how* the entities influence each other or *what action* connects them.\n\n3.  **Limited Guidance on Capturing Roles and Functions:**\n    *   The prompt does not explicitly guide the LLM to identify the *role* of an entity within the narrative or context. This is a significant limitation if the goal is to answer queries about character roles, plot functions, or thematic elements. The prompt should encourage the extraction of relationships that define roles (e.g., \"is_leader_of,\" \"is_part_of,\" \"serves_as,\" \"causes,\" \"prevents\").\n\n4.  **Potential for Over-Generalization and",
      "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the retrieval plan, focusing on areas for improvement:\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Repetitive Neighbor Exploration:** The most significant issue is the repeated retrieval of `Gurn`'s neighbors. Iterations 2, 4, and 5 all call `get_neighbors('Gurn')`. This demonstrates a lack of memory or an inability to synthesize previously retrieved information, leading to redundant and inefficient exploration. The system needs to better track what has already been queried and its results.\n\n2.  **Ineffective Strategy for \"Role\":** The query specifically asks for Gurn's \"role.\" While finding neighbors is a starting point, the subsequent steps don't effectively leverage this information to define a role.\n    *   Searching for other \"Person\" nodes (Iteration 3) is a reasonable idea, but it returning an empty graph should have prompted a pivot in strategy rather than continuing to explore Gurn's immediate vicinity again.\n    *   The jump to searching for \"is a\" relationships (Iteration 4) is somewhat logical for defining identity, but it seems to be misapplied. The plan doesn't specify *how* the results of `get_neighbors` would inform the search for \"is a\" relationships directly involving Gurn, or how Gurn's *role* specifically would be extracted from such a relation.\n\n3.  **Lack of Contextual Synthesis:** The plan doesn't show a clear progression of synthesizing information. For example, after getting Gurn's neighbors, the agent should analyze those neighbors and their relationships to infer Gurn's role. Instead, it often reverts to exploring Gurn's direct connections or unrelated entity types without a clear justification for how that advances understanding of Gurn's *role*.\n\n4.  **Over-reliance on General Searches:** While `search_nodes_by_keyword` and `get_neighbors` are good initial steps, the plan doesn't articulate a clear path to move from general connections to specific role information. The most frequent relationship types listed (attacks, interacts with, fights, kills) are highly relevant to defining a character's role, but the plan doesn't prioritize exploring these in relation to Gurn.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Implement Memory/State Tracking:** The agent must remember what information has been retrieved and avoid repeating identical function calls.\n*   **Focus on Query Intent:** Directly link exploration",
