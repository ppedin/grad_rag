Your goal is to analyze the provided critiques and recommend optimal hyperparameter values.\n\nWhen considering **chunk size**, evaluate the following:\n\n1.  **Granularity of Information:**\n    *   **Small Chunk Size:** Favors capturing highly localized details, specific actions, motivations, and direct relationships within a smaller context. This is beneficial for extracting nuanced character interactions and events.\n    *   **Large Chunk Size:** Captures broader context, potentially diluting specific details. It can be useful for understanding overarching themes but may lead to fragmented character context or missed implicit connections if key information is spread across unrelated segments.\n\n2.  **Implicit Relationship Detection:**\n    *   Smaller chunks can place related information closer together, increasing the likelihood of the LLM identifying subtle, implicit connections (e.g., loyalty to an exiled character, cause-and-effect between events) that might be obscured in larger, more diffuse chunks.\n\n3.  **Synthesizing Entity Roles:**\n    *   A chunk size that allows for cohesive narrative segments about an entity's actions, affiliations, and motivations is crucial for synthesizing their overall role. Overly large chunks can scatter this information, hindering comprehensive synthesis.\n\n**Recommendation Strategy:**\n\n*   **Analyze the critique for specific examples of missed information or fragmented context.**\n*   **If the critique highlights a need for more detailed character actions, motivations, or subtle connections, lean towards a smaller chunk size.**\n*   **If the critique suggests information is too broad or thematic, a larger chunk size might be appropriate, but always balance this with the risk of fragmentation.**\n\nBased on this, propose an adjusted chunk size, justifying your recommendation by referencing the specific critique points above.

  "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 500 seems adequate for capturing initial entity and relationship information, as evidenced by the graph's size (74 entities, 252 relationships). However, the critique of the retrieved information for the query \"What is Gurn's role in the story?\" reveals limitations that could be partially addressed by adjusting the chunk size.\n\n**Critique on Chunk Size Impact:**\n\n1.  **Fragmented Character Context:** The 500-token chunk size might be too large to capture highly localized, nuanced details about a character's actions and motivations within a single chunk. The critique highlights that Gurn is primarily defined relationally (brother, companion) and by his status (exile). This suggests that critical information about his *actions* or the *implications of his exile* might be scattered across different chunks, or worse, not captured cohesively within any single chunk due to the large context window. A smaller chunk size could potentially isolate more specific actions or motivations, allowing for richer relationship extraction for individual entities.\n\n2.  **Weakening of Implicit Connections:** The critique points out missed implicit connections, such as the loyalty of Vasads to Gurn and the connection between Gurn's exile and temple conflicts. These subtle, yet important, relationships might be diluted or obscured when the context is spread across a larger chunk. If information relevant to Gurn's loyalty and his exile are present in distinct sections of a 500-token chunk, the graph extraction might struggle to draw direct inferences between them, especially if other narrative elements dominate that chunk. A smaller chunk size could potentially create chunks where \"Vasads loyal to Gurn\" and \"Gurn's exile\" are discussed in closer proximity, or even within the same chunk, facilitating stronger link detection.\n\n3.  **Difficulty in Synthesizing Role:** The query \"What is Gurn's role?\" demands a synthesis of fragmented information into a coherent narrative function. If Gurn's actions, motivations, and affiliations are spread across many different 500-token chunks, the graph construction process will have a harder time building a comprehensive picture. Smaller chunks might offer more focused data points that, when aggregated, allow for a more accurate synthesis of his active role, rather than just his passive description.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nWhile 500 tokens is not inherently flawed, experimenting with a **smaller chunk size (e.g., 250-350 tokens)** could be beneficial. This might lead to:\n\n*   More granular extraction of character-specific actions and motivations.\n*   Stronger identification of implicit relationships by keeping related information in closer proximity.\n*   A more detailed foundation for synthesizing a character's overall role in the narrative.\n\nThis adjustment could help the graph capture richer details about characters like Gurn, leading to more insightful retrieval and answer generation.",
  "graph_builder_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the provided graph construction prompt, focusing on its limitations in capturing nuanced character roles and inter-community connections, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n**Critique of Graph Construction Prompt:**\n\n1.  **Overemphasis on Explicit Relationships, Underemphasis on Actions/Motivations:** The prompt heavily focuses on identifying entities and their explicit relationships (\"relationships among the identified entities\"). While crucial, this approach often leads to a static representation. For example, Gurn is defined by his relationships (brother, companion) and status (exile) rather than his actions or motivations. The prompt doesn't explicitly ask for verbs or actions that describe *what* entities do or *why*.\n\n2.  **Shallow \"Properties\" Field:** The \"properties\" field, while intended to describe characteristics, is often populated with descriptive phrases or simple affiliations (e.g., \"companion to Noork\"). It lacks a directive to capture a character's *agency*, *goals*, or *decisions*, which are vital for understanding their \"role.\" The prompt could be more specific about what kinds of properties are desired, such as \"actions taken,\" \"decisions made,\" or \"stated motivations.\"\n\n3.  **Limited Implicit Connection Handling:** The prompt's structure for relationship extraction is primarily pairwise and explicit. It struggles to capture implicit connections or the *implications* of relationships. The loyalty of \"Vasads to Gurn\" is noted but not explored for its strategic importance or Gurn's potential influence. The prompt doesn't encourage inferring connections based on context across different text segments.\n\n4.  **Weak Linkage of Status to Narrative Function:** Gurn's status as an \"exile from Grath\" is extracted but its narrative significance or how it might inform his actions and role is not emphasized by the prompt. The prompt needs to guide the LLM to consider how statuses might influence behavior or plot.\n\n5.  **Lack of Focus on \"Role\" Synthesis:** The prompt asks for \"entities\" and \"relationships,\" but the subsequent community summarization and retrieval are where \"role\" synthesis is needed. The graph extraction itself should ideally lay a better foundation for this synthesis by capturing more dynamic information. The current prompt, by focusing on static attributes, makes it harder for downstream components to answer a query about \"role.\"\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Incorporate Action-Oriented Extraction:** Modify the prompt to explicitly ask for extracted \"actions\" or \"events\" associated with entities. For example, a new category could be `actions: [{ verb: \"commands\", object: \"Vasads\", description: \"Gurn orders the Vasads.\" }]`.\n\n2.  **Refine \"Properties\" to Include Agency:** Expand the definition of \"properties\" to encourage capturing dynamic traits. Suggest properties like `motivations: \"Seeking redemption.\"`, `decisions: \"Chose to exile himself.\"`, `strategic_positioning: \"Leverages loyalty of Vasads.\"`.\n\n3.  **Prompt for Inferred or Contextual Relationships:** Add a directive to identify and describe *potential* or *implied* relationships, especially where loyalty or affiliation is mentioned. Include instructions like \"If an entity is loyal to another, consider what actions or influence this loyalty implies and document them.\"\n\n4.  **Emphasize Narrative Significance of Statuses:** When extracting properties or relationships, prompt the LLM to consider *why* a status is relevant. For instance, for \"exile,\" prompt to look for connections like \"exile from X led to Y action\" or \"exile from X influences Z motivation.\"\n\n5.  **Add a \"Role/Function\" Field (Optional but beneficial):** Consider a top-level field for key entities that explicitly asks for their narrative role, if strongly indicated in the text. This could be a short, synthesized statement derived from their actions and relationships.\n\nBy integrating these changes, the graph construction prompt can produce richer, more dynamic knowledge graphs that better support complex queries about character roles and implicit narrative connections.",
  "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "This critique focuses on the inadequacy of the selected communities for answering the query \"What is Gurn's role in the story?\"\n\nThe core issue is that the selection **fails to synthesize information to define Gurn's *role* as an active participant or influential figure**, instead providing only relational and descriptive context.\n\n**Critique Points:**\n\n1.  **Insufficiently Active Role Information:**\n    *   Community 0 correctly identifies Gurn but describes him relationally (brother to Tholon Sarna, companion to Noork) and by status (exile from Grath). It focuses on Noork's actions. Gurn's *agency* or direct contribution to the plot is not detailed. The fact that Vasads are \"loyal to Gurn\" is mentioned, but this loyalty's impact or Gurn's leverage from it is not explored.\n\n2.  **Missed Implicit Connections and Deeper Inferencing:**\n    *   The selection overlooks the potential for Gurn's role to be inferred from related elements. For instance, Community 8 mentions temple guards loyal to Gurn. The agent should have considered the implications of this loyalty for Gurn's position or influence within the temple hierarchy, especially in relation to his exile status.\n    *   Community 9, depicting conflict within a temple, could offer indirect insights into Gurn's potential sphere of influence or the types of conflicts he might be involved in, given his affiliations. The selection did not leverage these possibilities.\n\n3.  **Lack of Role Synthesis:**\n    *   The query demands a definition of Gurn's *role*, implying his function, motivations, and impact. The selected communities provide biographical fragments (exile, affiliation) but do not connect these to a narrative function. The *consequences* of being an \"exile from Grath\" are not explored.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n*   **Emphasize Active Role and Agency:** The prompt should instruct the agent to prioritize communities that detail a character's actions, decisions, motivations, and impact on the plot, not just their relationships or affiliations.\n*   **Incorporate Inferential Reasoning:** The prompt should encourage the agent to select communities that, while not directly mentioning the query subject, contain related entities, factions, locations, or events that could implicitly define the subject's role. This means looking for connections through loyalty, conflict, or influence.\n*   **Guide Towards Synthesis:** The prompt needs to explicitly ask the agent to *synthesize* the retrieved information to *define* the query subject's role, rather than just listing relevant facts. It should prompt for an explanation of *how* the character influences events or what their purpose is in the narrative.",

The LLM likely focused on extracting isolated facts about Gurn, as evidenced by the answer's fragmented nature.\n    *   **Improvement:** The prompt needs to encourage the LLM to **connect the dots** between different pieces of information and build a cohesive understanding.\n    *   **Revised Prompt Snippet:** \"Synthesize the retrieved information to construct a coherent description of the character's role. **Connect related pieces of information to explain how they contribute to the character's overall function in the story.**\"\n\n3.  **Vagueness Regarding \"Exploiting Information\":**\n    *   **Issue:** The phrase \"exploit the retrieved information, even if incomplete\" is too broad. It doesn't guide the LLM on *how* to exploit it effectively for understanding a role.\n    *   **Improvement:** Frame this as a need for **depth and elaboration.**\n    *   **Revised Prompt Snippet:** \"Focus on extracting details that reveal the character's **purpose and significance** within the narrative. **Elaborate on the provided context to paint a clear picture of their role.**\"\n\n4.  **Absence of Contextualization Instructions:**\n    *   **Issue:** The prompt doesn't ask the LLM to provide context for the retrieved information, which is crucial for understanding the significance of Gurn's associations (e.g., \"exile from Grath\").\n    *   **Improvement:** Instruct the LLM to briefly **explain the context or significance** of key relationships or circumstances mentioned.\n    *   **Revised Prompt Snippet:** \"Where relevant, briefly **explain the significance or context of the character's relationships and circumstances** to better illustrate their role.\"\n\n**Overall Impact:**\n\nBy incorporating these changes, the prompt will guide the LLM to move beyond a mere list of associations and instead synthesize a more descriptive and insightful answer that truly addresses the \"role\" of the character within the story. This should directly address the low ROUGE score by promoting the generation of more relevant and comprehensive information.",
