  "retrieved_context": "Community 0 - Rescue of Tholon Sarna from the Skull Temple:\nThis subgraph details the exploits of Noork, a hero from America, as he infiltrates a temple structure known as the Skull. Noork is on a mission to rescue Tholon Sarna, who is being held prisoner in a prison pit beneath the temple. Tholon Sarna is the sister of Gurn, an exile from Grath, and Noork's companion. The temple is guarded by invisible guards and populated by priests, some of whom are associated with Vasads, loyal to Gurn. Noork's journey through the temple involves navigating dimly lit caverns, approaching a metal-barred entrance, and confronting priests and a spotted narl. He is aided by his friendship with Gurn and the Vasads, who link Noork to the name \"New York.\" Noork's actions are featured in \"Planet Stories Summer 1945.\" The narrative highlights Noork's bravery and resourcefulness in overcoming obstacles to save Tholon Sarna, ultimately seeking peace with her and Gurn.\n\nCommunity 7 - Conflict and Deities: Konto, Zura, and Captives:\nThis community highlights the intricate web of relationships and conflicts between several key entities, primarily focusing on the city-states of Konto and Zura, and the individuals caught between them. The warriors of Konto are known for attacking slavers near Bis, while Rold, a person from Konto, is enslaved on the island of Manak. Sarna, daughter of Tholon Dist, has a complex relationship with both Bis, from which her captors marched, and Konto, which she actively avoids. Sarna is also a potential sacrifice to the deity Uzdon, who, along with his mate Lornu, is worshipped by the people of Zura. The white-haired man, safe on the island of Manak, expresses belief in Uzdon. The narrative touches on themes of conflict, slavery, religious devotion, and avoidance, painting a picture of a world where territorial disputes, spiritual beliefs, and personal fates are deeply intertwined.\n\nCommunity 8 - Temple Hierarchy and Desires:\nThis community depicts a temple setting with four key entities: the High Priest, beast men, slaves, and temple guards. The High Priest is aware of the temple guards' desire for slave women. Beast men and slaves are depicted as being mingled together, with their odors mixing in the temple, suggesting a close and potentially unpleasant proximity. The temple guards actively covet the slave women, though they are kept from seeing them until a sacrifice is chosen. This subgraph highlights themes of hierarchical power within the temple, unspoken desires, and the distinct roles and interactions between different groups, particularly concerning the objectification and control of slaves.\n\nCommunity 9 - Guard's Demise and Priest's Arsenal:\nThis community depicts a dramatic encounter centered around a fallen guard and a priest of the Skull. The guard, once alive, has become a corpse, obstructing the stairs. During a struggle, guards fall down these same stairs, with one dropping their sword. The priest of the Skull is a central figure, wielding a sword and adorned with both robes of invisibility and the sacred window of Uzdon. The interactions highlight themes of conflict, the aftermath of violence, and the mystical or ceremonial elements associated with the priest.\n\nCommunity 10 - Warriors, Cloaks, and a Club in a Room:\nThis community describes a scene involving **warriors** found within a **room**. The room is accessible via a **doorway** and contains **hooded cloaks** hanging on pegs. One of the **warriors** is associated with a **club**, which is used for striking. This subgraph depicts a tense or potentially combative environment where warriors are present in a guarded or hidden space, suggested by the presence of cloaks.",

    "evaluation_feedback": "The RAG system's response is a decent starting point, but it can be significantly improved for clarity, accuracy, and completeness. The ROUGE score of 0.1166 is quite low, indicating that there's a substantial gap between the generated response and what would be considered an ideal answer.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the evaluation and suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Evaluation of the Current Response:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly identifies Gurn's relationship to Tholon Sarna (brother).\n    *   It mentions Gurn's status as an exile from Grath.\n    *   It establishes Gurn as a companion to Noork.\n    *   It highlights Gurn's motivation (rescuing Tholon Sarna).\n    *   It mentions Gurn's allies (Vasads).\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Lack of Specificity:** \"Hero from America\" is vague. The story likely has a more specific context for Noork's origin or role.\n    *   **Redundancy/Awkward Phrasing:** \"Gurn is an exile... He is a companion...\" could be more smoothly integrated.\n    *   **Incomplete Role:** While it mentions he's a companion and has allies, it doesn't delve into *how* he fulfills his role. Is he a strategist, a fighter, a guide, a moral compass?\n    *   **Potential for Misinterpretation:** The phrase \"loyal to him and assist Noork\" could imply the Vasads are loyal *to Gurn* and then *also* assist Noork, which might not be the primary dynamic. Are they loyal to the cause Gurn represents, or directly to Gurn?\n    *   **ROUGE Score:** The low ROUGE score confirms that the response is not capturing enough of the key information or is not structured in a way that aligns with a good reference answer.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\nTo improve the response, the RAG system needs to access more detailed information about Gurn's character, his motivations, his actions, and his relationships within the narrative.\n\nHere are specific areas for improvement and how they could be addressed:\n\n1.  **Elaborate on Gurn's \"Exile\" Status:**\n    *   **What does being an exile mean for Gurn?** Is he ostracized, hunted, or has he chosen to live apart?\n    *   **Why was he exiled?** Was it voluntary, a punishment, or due to circumstances beyond his control?\n    *   **How does his exile status influence his actions or perspective?**\n\n2.  **Define Noork's Role and Origin More Precisely:**\n    *   Instead of \"hero from America,\" the response should ideally state Noork's specific origin (e.g., \"a skilled warrior from the American continent,\" or \"a special operative from the United States\").\n    *   Clarify Noork's mission: Is it solely to rescue Tholon, or does Gurn join him for other reasons?\n\n3.  **Detail Gurn's Contribution as a Companion:**\n    *   **What specific actions does Gurn take to support Noork?** Does he provide knowledge of the area, combat assistance, strategic advice, or emotional support?\n    *   **What are his skills or strengths that make him a valuable companion?** (e.g., knowledge of Grath, combat experience, understanding of the Skull Temple's layout).\n\n4.  **Clarify the Relationship with the Vasads:**\n    *   Are the Vasads Gurn's personal followers, or a faction he has influence over?\n    *   What is their motivation for assisting Noork? Is it loyalty to Gurn, a shared enemy, or a belief in Noork's mission?\n    *   How do the Vasads contribute to the rescue mission?\n\n5.  **Strengthen the Narrative Flow and Connection:**\n    *   Instead of listing facts, weave them into a coherent description of Gurn's role and purpose in the story.\n\n**Example of an Improved Response (Hypothetical, based on potential missing information):**\n\n\"Gurn is a key figure in the narrative, serving as an **exiled warrior from the land of Grath** and the brother of Tholon Sarna. His primary motivation is to **secure the rescue of his brother**, whom he believes is held captive within the Skull Temple. To achieve this, Gurn allies himself with **Noork, a formidable operative originating from the United States**, who is undertaking a dangerous infiltration mission. Gurn acts as Noork's **guide and tactical advisor**, leveraging his intimate knowledge of Grath's treacherous territories and the intricacies of the Skull Temple. Furthermore, Gurn commands the **loyalty of the Vasad tribe**, a faction that provides crucial support and manpower to Noork's efforts, demonstrating Gurn's influence and his commitment to his brother's liberation.\"\n\n**How the RAG System Can Be Trained/Tuned:**\n\n*   **Data Augmentation:** Ensure the training data includes detailed character descriptions, plot summaries, and relationship dynamics for the story in question.\n*   **Retrieval Mechanism Tuning:** Improve the system's ability to retrieve highly relevant passages from the knowledge base that specifically detail Gurn's actions, motivations, and relationships. This might involve tuning embeddings or keyword matching.\n*   **Prompt Engineering:** The prompt could be made more specific, asking for Gurn's \"role, motivations, and key contributions to the plot.\"\n*   **Answer Generation Refinement:** Post-processing steps could involve checking for factual consistency, fluency, and completeness against a more comprehensive reference answer.\n\nBy addressing these points, the RAG system can generate responses that are not only factually accurate but also provide a deeper, more nuanced understanding of Gurn's character and his significance within the story.",

Your goal is to intelligently determine the most effective `chunk_size` for graph construction based on input documents.\n\nWhen considering `chunk_size`, you must prioritize the following:\n\n1.  **Contextual Completeness for Entity Resolution:** A `chunk_size` must be large enough to contain sufficient context for accurate entity recognition and coreference resolution. Avoid chunking in a way that splits crucial information needed to disambiguate entities or link related mentions. A good chunk should ideally contain a complete thought or narrative unit related to an entity.\n\n2.  **Relationship Integrity:** Ensure relationships between entities are not fragmented across chunk boundaries. Larger, more coherent chunks will preserve the integrity of connections, leading to stronger edges in the graph and more meaningful community structures. Consider how a typical interaction or description of a relationship would fit within a single chunk.\n\n3.  **Community Cohesion and Granularity:** The `chunk_size` directly impacts community detection. A well-chosen size should facilitate the formation of cohesive, informative communities rather than overly fragmented, insignificant clusters. It should enable the representation of broader themes and arcs by grouping related information meaningfully, rather than breaking it into numerous small, disconnected parts. Avoid sizes that lead to an overwhelming number of trivial communities.\n\n4.  **LLM Agent's Retrieval Effectiveness:** The `chunk_size` influences the quality of graph summaries and descriptions. Larger, more contextually rich chunks lead to better-summarized communities, enabling the LLM agent to more accurately assess relevance and select the most pertinent information for answering queries.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nAnalyze the characteristics of the provided documents (e.g., average sentence length, paragraph structure, narrative flow, information density) and recommend an optimal `chunk_size` (in tokens) for graph construction. Justify your recommendation by explaining how it addresses the principles of contextual completeness, relationship integrity, community cohesion, and LLM agent effectiveness. Avoid arbitrary choices; base your decision on these strategic considerations.\n\nConsider a range of values, but focus on a size that balances information containment with practical graph construction. A size that captures paragraphs or small narrative segments is generally preferred over very small, sentence-level chunks.",

Your goal is to retrieve information that directly addresses the query and avoid irrelevant or tangential data.\n\n**Core Principles for Community Selection:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Direct Entity Mentions:** Communities that explicitly mention the primary entity or entities in the user query (e.g., \"Gurn\") are of the highest relevance.\n2.  **Establish Direct Relationships:** Communities that describe direct relationships, affiliations, or interactions involving the query entity are highly valuable. This includes explicitly stated family members (e.g., \"Tholon Sarna\" if Gurn's sister), known associates, or defined roles (e.g., \"exile\").\n3.  **Focus on Query Intent:** The selection must directly address the user's intent. For queries asking about a \"role,\" prioritize communities that detail the entity's actions, status, significance, or connections within the narrative.\n4.  **Strict Relevance Filtering:**\n    *   **Exclude Tangential Content:** Communities lacking direct mentions of the query entity or its established, explicitly stated connections should be excluded. Thematic or speculative overlaps are insufficient.\n    *   **Avoid Ambiguity:** If a term in the query (like \"Sarna\") can refer to multiple entities, only select communities that explicitly link that term to the correct context of the query entity (e.g., \"Gurn's sister Sarna\"). Otherwise, exclude the community.\n    *   **Contextualize Names:** Do not assume relevance based on names alone. Verify the context. For example, a \"Sarna\" mentioned without connection to \"Gurn\" or his explicit family is irrelevant.\n    *   **Reject Speculation:** Reasoning for selection should be based on factual content within the community, not on potential or hypothetical connections. Phrases like \"could be related\" or \"potential role\" indicate weak relevance and should lead to exclusion.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\n*   **Evaluate each community:** Determine if it contains direct mentions of the query entity, its explicitly defined relationships, or details directly pertaining to its role, actions, or status.\n*   **Assign relevance scores:** Implicitly rank communities based on the strength of their direct connection to the query.\n*   **Select Top Communities:** Choose a concise set of the *most* relevant communities that provide direct and unambiguous answers to the query. Prioritize those that offer definitive information over those offering weak or speculative links.\n\nYour output should be a list of community IDs, ordered by relevance, with a brief justification for each selection based on the principles above.

      "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 150 tokens, while seemingly reasonable, likely contributes to the identified issues in the GraphRAG system, particularly regarding entity ambiguity and community cohesion.\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (150 tokens):**\n\n1.  **Insufficient Context for Entity Resolution:** A chunk size of 150 tokens might be too small to capture sufficient context for robust entity recognition and coreference resolution. Key information needed to disambiguate entities (like the two \"Sarna\" instances) might span across multiple such small chunks. When these chunks are processed into the graph, it's harder to link them correctly, leading to the \"Unknown\" entity type prevalence and ambiguity. For example, if a character's introduction and a later mention of their relationship are in separate 150-token chunks, the graph might struggle to connect them as the same person or establish their familial ties effectively.\n\n2.  **Fragmented Relationships and Weak Edges:** Smaller chunks can lead to fragmented relationships. A single, meaningful relationship between two entities might be split across chunk boundaries. When graphs are merged, these fragmented relationships can become weak or incomplete, diminishing their significance. This directly impacts the community detection, as weakly connected entities are less likely to be clustered together cohesively. If Gurn's interactions are described across several small, distinct segments, the resulting graph might not capture the density of his connections, leading to shallow communities.\n\n3.  **Suboptimal Community Granularity:** A chunk size of 150 tokens might lead to an overly granular graph structure. While this could theoretically create many small, focused communities, it can also result in:\n    *   **Too many insignificant communities:** Each community might contain very little information, making it difficult for the LLM agent to find truly relevant ones among a sea of minor clusters.\n    *   **Difficulty in identifying broader themes:** Important overarching themes or character arcs that span more than 150 tokens might be broken into numerous small, disconnected communities, preventing their holistic representation. This could explain why Community 0 was the *only* relevant one, suggesting that information about Gurn was either highly concentrated or other relevant information was too fragmented.\n\n4.  **Impact on LLM Agent's Decision Making:** The LLM agent selecting communities relies on titles and descriptions. If communities are too small or fragmented due to chunking, their summaries might be superficial or lack the rich context needed for accurate relevance assessment. This can lead to the agent selecting irrelevant communities based on superficial keyword matches (as seen with communities 7-10) because the underlying semantic connections are weak or broken due to the chunking strategy.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nExperiment with a larger chunk size. A size that allows for more complete sentences, paragraphs, or even small narrative units would likely improve entity resolution, strengthen relationship representation, and lead to more cohesive and informative communities, thereby enhancing the retrieval and answer generation process. The optimal size will depend on the text's average sentence/paragraph length and the density of information.",
      "graph_builder_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the provided graph construction prompt, focusing on its limitations in capturing nuanced character roles and inter-community connections, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n**Critique of Graph Construction Prompt:**\n\n1.  **Overemphasis on Explicit Relationships, Underemphasis on Actions/Motivations:** The prompt heavily focuses on identifying entities and their explicit relationships (\"relationships among the identified entities\"). While crucial, this approach often leads to a static representation. For example, Gurn is defined by his relationships (brother, companion) and status (exile) rather than his actions or motivations. The prompt doesn't explicitly ask for verbs or actions that describe *what* entities do or *why*.\n\n2.  **Shallow \"Properties\" Field:** The \"properties\" field, while intended to describe characteristics, is often populated with descriptive phrases or simple affiliations (e.g., \"companion to Noork\"). It lacks a directive to capture a character's *agency*, *goals*, or *decisions*, which are vital for understanding their \"role.\" The prompt could be more specific about what kinds of properties are desired, such as \"actions taken,\" \"decisions made,\" or \"stated motivations.\"\n\n3.  **Limited Implicit Connection Handling:** The prompt's structure for relationship extraction is primarily pairwise and explicit. It struggles to capture implicit connections or the *implications* of relationships. The loyalty of \"Vasads to Gurn\" is noted but not explored for its strategic importance or Gurn's potential influence. The prompt doesn't encourage inferring connections based on context across different text segments.\n\n4.  **Weak Linkage of Status to Narrative Function:** Gurn's status as an \"exile from Grath\" is extracted but its narrative significance or how it might inform his actions and role is not emphasized by the prompt. The prompt needs to guide the LLM to consider how statuses might influence behavior or plot.\n\n5.  **Lack of Focus on \"Role\" Synthesis:** The prompt asks for \"entities\" and \"relationships,\" but the subsequent community summarization and retrieval are where \"role\" synthesis is needed. The graph extraction itself should ideally lay a better foundation for this synthesis by capturing more dynamic information. The current prompt, by focusing on static attributes, makes it harder for downstream components to answer a query about \"role.\"\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Incorporate Action-Oriented Extraction:** Modify the prompt to explicitly ask for extracted \"actions\" or \"events\" associated with entities. For example, a new category could be `actions: [{ verb: \"commands\", object: \"Vasads\", description: \"Gurn orders the Vasads.\" }]`.\n\n2.  **Refine \"Properties\" to Include Agency:** Expand the definition of \"properties\" to encourage capturing dynamic traits. Suggest properties like `motivations: \"Seeking redemption.\"`, `decisions: \"Chose to exile himself.\"`, `strategic_positioning: \"Leverages loyalty of Vasads.\"`.\n\n3.  **Prompt for Inferred or Contextual Relationships:** Add a directive to identify and describe *potential* or *implied* relationships, especially where loyalty or affiliation is mentioned. Include instructions like \"If an entity is loyal to another, consider what actions or influence this loyalty implies and document them.\"\n\n4.  **Emphasize Narrative Significance of Statuses:** When extracting properties or relationships, prompt the LLM to consider *why* a status is relevant. For instance, for \"exile,\" prompt to look for connections like \"exile from X led to Y action\" or \"exile from X influences Z motivation.\"\n\n5.  **Add a \"Role/Function\" Field (Optional but beneficial):** Consider a top-level field for key entities that explicitly asks for their narrative role, if strongly indicated in the text. This could be a short, synthesized statement derived from their actions and relationships.\n\nBy integrating these changes, the graph construction prompt can produce richer, more dynamic knowledge graphs that better support complex queries about character roles and implicit narrative connections.",
      "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The community selection for the query \"What is Gurn's role in the story?\" demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of relevance and context, leading to significant over-retrieval of irrelevant information.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Poor Relevance Filtering:** The primary failure is the inclusion of Communities 7, 8, 9, and 10. These communities have absolutely no mention of \"Gurn\" or any directly related context.\n    *   Community 7's mention of \"Sarna\" is misleading, as it refers to \"Sarna, daughter of Tholon Dist,\" not Gurn's sister \"Tholon Sarna.\" The absence of Gurn makes this community irrelevant.\n    *   Communities 8, 9, and 10 focus on temple settings, guards, priests, and warriors. None of these provide any insight into Gurn's role. Their inclusion is entirely speculative and dilutes the retrieval.\n\n2.  **Lack of Entity Focus:** The prompt instructs the agent to select communities relevant to \"Gurn's role.\" The agent failed to prioritize communities that directly mention or describe Gurn. Community 0 is the *only* relevant community, explicitly stating Gurn's relationship to Tholon Sarna and his status as an exile.\n\n3.  **Failure to Disambiguate:** The agent did not recognize or address the potential confusion with the name \"Sarna.\" This ambiguity should have been flagged, and Community 7 excluded due to the lack of confirmation that it pertains to Gurn's narrative.\n\n4.  **Overly Broad Interpretation:** The reasoning for selecting Communities 7, 8, and 9 (\"could be directly related to Gurn's role, actions, or context\") is too vague. The prompt needs to encourage more direct connections rather than speculative ones. Community 10's reasoning (\"potential role or affiliation for Gurn\") is similarly weak.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Strengthen Direct Relevance Criteria:** Modify the prompt to heavily penalize communities lacking direct mentions of the query entity (\"Gurn\") or its explicitly stated relatives/affiliations (e.g., \"Tholon Sarna,\" \"Noork\"). Communities 8, 9, and 10 should have been automatically excluded. Community 7 requires explicit evidence linking \"Sarna\" to Gurn's sister.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Direct Mentions:** Emphasize that communities with direct mentions of the query entity are the highest priority. The agent should be instructed to favor these strongly.\n\n3.  **Implement Disambiguation Logic:** Instruct the agent to identify and flag potential ambiguities (like the \"Sarna\" name) and exclude communities where such ambiguities are not resolved by direct links to the query entity.\n\n4.  **Refine \"Role\" Interpretation:** Clarify that \"role\" implies information about Gurn's actions, relationships, affiliations, status, or narrative significance, not just tangential thematic overlaps.",

Here's a critique focused on improving the prompt:\n\n**Critique of Previous Prompt:**\n\n1.  **Overly General \"Prioritize Core Narrative Role\":** Instruction 1 is good but too broad. It doesn't explicitly guide the LLM to seek *specific types* of information that are crucial for character analysis.

Instead of \"primary function, most impactful contributions, and significant motivations,\" prompt for \"Gurn's **specific actions, strategic contributions, and defining relationships** that drive the plot.\"\n\n2.  **\"Handle Obscure Information Prudently\" is Vague:** Instruction 3 is a good principle, but the prompt doesn't instruct the LLM on *how* to assess obscurity or importance. The feedback notes vagueness like \"hero from America.\"\n    *   **Improvement:** Add guidance on prioritizing concrete details over vague descriptors. For example, instruct the LLM to \"Prioritize specific affiliations, origins, and actions over general titles or vague descriptions. If information is vague (e.g., 'hero from America'), attempt to contextualize it or note its ambiguity if further detail isn't available.\"\n\n3.  **\"Structure for Clarity\" Lacks Emphasis on Interconnectedness:** Instruction 4 suggests a structure but doesn't push for the *synthesis* of how these elements connect. The feedback points out the need to connect Gurn's role as a companion and his relationship with the Vasads.\n    *   **Improvement:** Modify Instruction 4 to explicitly ask for the *connection* between different aspects. For example, \"Begin by stating Gurn's primary role. Then, detail how his background (exile status, relationships) informs his motivations and actions, and how these directly support or influence other characters (like Noork) and factions (like the Vasads).\"\n\n4.  **\"Synthesize and Avoid Redundancy\" Needs More Actionable Guidance:** Instruction 5 is a good goal, but the prompt doesn't tell the LLM *what kind* of synthesis to perform. The feedback noted awkward phrasing and potential misinterpretation of the Vasad loyalty.\n    *   **Improvement:** Add a directive for causal linkage. \"Explicitly connect Gurn's actions and attributes to their consequences or impacts on the narrative. For instance, explain *how* his knowledge of Grath aids Noork, or *why* the Vasads are loyal and *how* they assist.\"\n\n5.  **Missing Emphasis on \"Why\":** The feedback strongly suggests understanding *why* Gurn is exiled, *why* he allies with Noork, and *why* the Vasads are loyal. The current prompt doesn't explicitly demand this depth of understanding.\n    *   **Improvement:** Add a specific instruction like, \"When describing Gurn's role, motivations, and relationships, always strive to explain the 'why' behind them, linking them directly to the plot's progression.\"\n\nBy making these adjustments, the prompt can become more effective in guiding the LLM to produce more detailed, connected, and contextually rich answers, directly addressing the weaknesses identified in the provided feedback.",

Your goal is to identify entities in the text and all the relationships among the identified entities.\nFor each entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text (e.g., for a person: age, role, description; for a location: description, significance). Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each relationship, you will include its type, a description (why you think the two entities are related to each other), and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the extracted entities.\nProvide a list of triplets in your answer.\n\nReturn no more than 20 entities and 30 relationships. \n\nText:\n{TEXT_CHUNK}\n\nProvide the reasoning that led to your response.\n",
