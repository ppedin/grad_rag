  "retrieved_context": "Community 0 - Rescue of Tholon Sarna from the Skull Temple:\nThis subgraph details the exploits of Noork, a hero from America, as he infiltrates a temple structure known as the Skull. Noork is on a mission to rescue Tholon Sarna, who is being held prisoner in a prison pit beneath the temple. Tholon Sarna is the sister of Gurn, an exile from Grath, and Noork's companion. The temple is guarded by invisible guards and populated by priests, some of whom are associated with Vasads, loyal to Gurn. Noork's journey through the temple involves navigating dimly lit caverns, approaching a metal-barred entrance, and confronting priests and a spotted narl. He is aided by his friendship with Gurn and the Vasads, who link Noork to the name \"New York.\" Noork's actions are featured in \"Planet Stories Summer 1945.\" The narrative highlights Noork's bravery and resourcefulness in overcoming obstacles to save Tholon Sarna, ultimately seeking peace with her and Gurn.\n\nCommunity 7 - Conflict and Deities: Konto, Zura, and Captives:\nThis community highlights the intricate web of relationships and conflicts between several key entities, primarily focusing on the city-states of Konto and Zura, and the individuals caught between them. The warriors of Konto are known for attacking slavers near Bis, while Rold, a person from Konto, is enslaved on the island of Manak. Sarna, daughter of Tholon Dist, has a complex relationship with both Bis, from which her captors marched, and Konto, which she actively avoids. Sarna is also a potential sacrifice to the deity Uzdon, who, along with his mate Lornu, is worshipped by the people of Zura. The white-haired man, safe on the island of Manak, expresses belief in Uzdon. The narrative touches on themes of conflict, slavery, religious devotion, and avoidance, painting a picture of a world where territorial disputes, spiritual beliefs, and personal fates are deeply intertwined.\n\nCommunity 8 - Temple Hierarchy and Desires:\nThis community depicts a temple setting with four key entities: the High Priest, beast men, slaves, and temple guards. The High Priest is aware of the temple guards' desire for slave women. Beast men and slaves are depicted as being mingled together, with their odors mixing in the temple, suggesting a close and potentially unpleasant proximity. The temple guards actively covet the slave women, though they are kept from seeing them until a sacrifice is chosen. This subgraph highlights themes of hierarchical power within the temple, unspoken desires, and the distinct roles and interactions between different groups, particularly concerning the objectification and control of slaves.\n\nCommunity 9 - Guard's Demise and Priest's Arsenal:\nThis community depicts a dramatic encounter centered around a fallen guard and a priest of the Skull. The guard, once alive, has become a corpse, obstructing the stairs. During a struggle, guards fall down these same stairs, with one dropping their sword. The priest of the Skull is a central figure, wielding a sword and adorned with both robes of invisibility and the sacred window of Uzdon. The interactions highlight themes of conflict, the aftermath of violence, and the mystical or ceremonial elements associated with the priest.\n\nCommunity 10 - Warriors, Cloaks, and a Club in a Room:\nThis community describes a scene involving **warriors** found within a **room**. The room is accessible via a **doorway** and contains **hooded cloaks** hanging on pegs. One of the **warriors** is associated with a **club**, which is used for striking. This subgraph depicts a tense or potentially combative environment where warriors are present in a guarded or hidden space, suggested by the presence of cloaks.",

    "evaluation_feedback": "The RAG system's response is decent but could be significantly improved for clarity, conciseness, and a more direct answer to the query.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the evaluation and suggestions:\n\n**Evaluation of the Current Response:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Identifies Key Relationships:** The response correctly identifies Gurn's relationship with Noork (ally, companion) and the central plot point involving Gurn's sister, Tholon Sarna.\n    *   **Includes Relevant Details:** It mentions Gurn's exile status and the Vasads' loyalty, which are relevant contextual details.\n    *   **Connects to the Protagonist's Motivation:** It clearly states that Gurn's sister's captivity is a primary motivation for Noork.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Redundancy:** The sentence \"Gurn's actions and motivations are directly linked to this rescue mission\" essentially repeats information already provided.\n    *   **Wordiness:** Some sentences are a bit long and could be more direct. For example, \"Gurn is described as an exile from Grath. This exile status might inform his motivations or the circumstances that led to his sister's predicament.\" is a bit speculative and could be stated more factually if the source material supports it.\n    *   **Unclear Connection to \"New York\":** The mention of Vasads linking Noork to \"New York\" is quite obscure and might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the source material. It feels like a tangential detail that doesn't strongly contribute to defining Gurn's *role*.\n    *   **Slightly Passive Voice/Indirectness:** Phrases like \"is described as\" or \"might inform\" can sometimes make the description less impactful.\n    *   **Overemphasis on Minor Details:** While the Vasads are mentioned, their direct role in linking to \"New York\" seems to overshadow Gurn's more primary functions.\n\n*   **ROUGE Score (0.1607):** This score is quite low, indicating that the generated response has limited overlap with a hypothetical ideal (or reference) response. This suggests that the system missed key information, phrased things poorly, or included irrelevant details. The low score strongly supports the identified weaknesses.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\nThe goal is to create a more focused, concise, and directly answering response that clearly defines Gurn's role.\n\n1.  **Prioritize the Core Role:** Gurn's primary role is that of a motivation and an ally for Noork, stemming from his sister's captivity. This should be stated upfront and unequivocally.\n\n2.  **Streamline Explanations:** Combine related ideas and remove redundancy.\n\n3.  **Clarify or Remove Obscure Details:** The \"New York\" connection is particularly problematic. If it's not a significant or well-explained aspect of Gurn's role, it should be omitted or contextualized much better.\n\n4.  **Strengthen Directness:** Use more active voice where appropriate and get straight to the point.\n\n**Revised Response Example (incorporating suggestions):**\n\nHere are a few options, ranging from more concise to slightly more detailed:\n\n**Option 1 (Most Concise):**\n\n> Gurn's primary role in the story is that of a **key motivation and steadfast ally** for the protagonist, Noork. Gurn's sister, Tholon Sarna, is held captive in the Skull Temple, making her rescue the central objective of Noork's mission. Gurn's connection to Noork is further solidified by his companionship and the loyalty of his followers, the Vasads, who support Noork's efforts.\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly More Detailed, addressing exile):**\n\n> Gurn serves as a **crucial motivator and companion** for Noork. His sister, Tholon Sarna, is a captive in the Skull Temple, providing the primary impetus for Noork's dangerous quest. As an exile from Grath, Gurn's own history might influence his situation, but his most significant role is his alliance with Noork. The loyalty of Gurn's followers, the Vasads, also extends to aiding Noork, highlighting Gurn's influence and importance in the narrative.\n\n**Option 3 (Addressing the \"New York\" ambiguity more carefully, if it *is* important):**\n\n> Gurn's role is multifaceted, primarily defined by his **status as a motivation and ally** to Noork. The captivity of Gurn's sister, Tholon Sarna, in the Skull Temple is the driving force behind Noork's mission. Gurn's exile from Grath may provide context for this situation. He is also a companion to Noork, and his influence is evident through the Vasads, who are loyal to him and actively assist Noork, facilitating certain connections or communications (such as linking to the name \"New York\"). Ultimately, Gurn is central to Noork's quest for rescue and the subsequent peace it will bring.\n\n**Why these are improvements:**\n\n*   **Directness:** They start by stating Gurn's role clearly.\n*   **Conciseness:** Redundant phrases are removed, and sentences are tightened.\n*   **Focus:** The emphasis remains on Gurn's relationship with Noork and his sister's captivity, which are his most significant contributions to the plot.\n*   **Clarity:** The \"New York\" detail is either omitted (if minor) or placed in a context that acknowledges its potentially confusing nature.\n*   **Higher ROUGE Potential:** These revised responses are more likely to have stronger overlap with a well-written reference answer due to their focused and direct nature.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can provide more effective and informative answers.",

Your task is to analyze provided text and recommend optimal hyperparameters for knowledge graph construction, with a primary focus on **chunk size**.\n\nWhen determining the optimal chunk size, consider the following critical factors, derived from analysis of entity resolution and relationship extraction challenges:\n\n1.  **Entity Resolution Context:** A chunk must contain enough surrounding text to disambiguate entities. Prioritize chunk sizes that maximize the likelihood of all mentions of a key entity (characters, locations, organizations, etc.) appearing within a single chunk. This helps resolve ambiguities like \"Priest\" vs. \"Priest of the Skull\" or variations in names like \"Tholon Sarna\" vs. \"Sarna.\"\n\n2.  **Relationship and Action Completeness:** Chunk boundaries should ideally not fragment crucial relationships and actions. Aim for chunk sizes that allow for the complete description of connections (e.g., `GURN -IS_SIBLING_OF-> THOLON_SARNA`, `GURN -HAS_LOYAL_GROUP-> VASADS`). Fragmented descriptions lead to incomplete graph structures and require speculative inference.\n\n3.  **Information Specificity vs. Generality:** While some general context is necessary, chunks should primarily focus on consolidating specific, relevant information. A larger chunk size can help group related factual details, making them more prominent for graph construction. Avoid chunk sizes that excessively dilute specific facts with broad, less relevant narrative. However, also consider that excessively large chunks might dilute specific information if they contain too much unrelated narrative.\n\n**Task:**\n\nBased on the text provided, propose an optimal chunk size (in tokens). Justify your recommendation by explaining how the chosen size addresses the above factors. Suggest a range (e.g., 200-400 tokens) if a single value is uncertain, and explain the trade-offs. You will also be asked to suggest other relevant hyperparameters if the text provides sufficient context.\n\nYour goal is to recommend parameters that facilitate the creation of a well-connected, accurate, and informative knowledge graph from the given text.

Your primary goal is to identify communities that *directly* contribute information about the specific entities and concepts mentioned in the query.\n\nWhen evaluating communities for relevance to the query, adhere to the following principles:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Direct Entity Mentions:** Give highest importance to communities that explicitly mention the key entities from the query. For the query \"[QUERY_ENTITY]\", seek communities that directly discuss \"[QUERY_ENTITY]\", its actions, relationships, attributes, or status.\n\n2.  **Enforce Granular Relevance:** Do not select communities based on superficial keyword matches or broad thematic similarities alone. The content of a community must specifically illuminate aspects of the query entity or concept. For \"[QUERY_ENTITY]\", assess *how* each community's information helps define their role, actions, or significance. Generic mentions of related concepts (e.g., \"warriors\" when the query is about a specific warrior) are insufficient if \"[QUERY_ENTITY]\" is not directly involved.\n\n3.  **Discourage Tangential or Ambiguous Links:** Avoid selecting communities where connections are indirect, ambiguous, or based on weakly associated terms. If a community mentions a related term but does not clearly link it to the query entity in a meaningful way, do not select it. For example, if a community mentions a character with a similar name but distinct identity, do not include it if it doesn't clarify the query entity.\n\n4.  **Focus on Role-Defining Information:** Actively seek communities that describe the query entity's \"role, actions, relationships, motivations, or status.\" Information that directly answers \"What is X's role?\" or describes X's specific involvement is paramount.\n\n5.  **Identify and Justify Selection:** For each community you select, provide a concise justification explaining *why* it is relevant to the query, specifically referencing how it directly addresses the query entity and its role.\n\n**Example Query:** \"What is Gurn's role in the story?\"\n\n**Selection Strategy:**\n*   Prioritize communities explicitly mentioning \"Gurn\".\n*   Look for descriptions of Gurn's relationships (e.g., with Tholon Sarna, Noork), his actions (e.g., exile, companionship), or his status.\n*   Reject communities that only mention generic terms like \"temple,\" \"conflict,\" or \"warriors\" without a direct link to Gurn's specific role or involvement.\n*   Be wary of communities mentioning similarly named entities (e.g., different \"Sarna\" individuals) that could cause confusion.\n\nYour task is to present a list of community IDs that strictly adhere to these guidelines, ensuring that the retrieved information will directly and accurately answer the user's query.",

      "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The current chunk size of 100 appears to be a significant contributing factor to the identified issues in the knowledge graph.\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size 100:**\n\n1.  **Insufficient Context for Entity Resolution:** A chunk size of 100 tokens is likely too small to capture sufficient contextual information for robust entity resolution. The critique highlights the confusion between \"Tholon Sarna\" and \"Sarna,\" and \"Priest\" and \"Priest of the Skull.\" These instances suggest that the surrounding text within a 100-token chunk might not consistently provide enough disambiguating information to link identical entities or differentiate distinct ones. Larger chunks would increase the probability of encountering all mentions of a character or role within a single piece of text, aiding in their unification.\n\n2.  **Fragmented Relationships and Actions:** The critique emphasizes the need for explicit, typed relationships (e.g., `GURN -IS_SIBLING_OF-> THOLON_SARNA`, `GURN -HAS_LOYAL_GROUP-> VASADS`). Small chunks can break apart these relationships. For instance, a sentence describing Gurn's loyalty to Vasads might be split across two chunks, or the description of Gurn's companion status might be separated from the mention of Noork. This fragmentation forces the graph extraction to infer relationships from incomplete data, leading to ambiguity or missed connections.\n\n3.  **Over-Inclusion of General Context (and potential under-inclusion of specific context):** While the critique suggests some communities contain too much general context, a small chunk size can also *prevent* the system from identifying and prioritizing *specific*, relevant context. If crucial details about Gurn's role or actions are spread across many small, disconnected chunks, the graph extraction might dilute these specific facts with broader narrative elements present in other chunks. Conversely, if a chunk *only* contains general world-building text, it contributes to the \"over-inclusion\" problem without offering specific, query-relevant information. A larger chunk size could help group related specific details together, making them more prominent during graph construction.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nIncreasing the chunk size is strongly recommended. A larger chunk size (e.g., 200-400 tokens) would likely:\n*   Improve entity resolution by providing more surrounding text for disambiguation.\n*   Allow for the capture of more complete relationships and actions within single chunks.\n*   Help in consolidating specific, relevant information and potentially filtering out less relevant narrative details if the larger chunks are more cohesive.\n\nThe goal is to find a balance where chunks are large enough to contain meaningful context for entity and relationship extraction but not so large as to become unwieldy or dilute specific information with excessive narrative.",
      "graph_builder_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the provided graph construction prompt, focusing on its limitations in capturing nuanced character roles and inter-community connections, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n**Critique of Graph Construction Prompt:**\n\n1.  **Overemphasis on Explicit Relationships, Underemphasis on Actions/Motivations:** The prompt heavily focuses on identifying entities and their explicit relationships (\"relationships among the identified entities\"). While crucial, this approach often leads to a static representation. For example, Gurn is defined by his relationships (brother, companion) and status (exile) rather than his actions or motivations. The prompt doesn't explicitly ask for verbs or actions that describe *what* entities do or *why*.\n\n2.  **Shallow \"Properties\" Field:** The \"properties\" field, while intended to describe characteristics, is often populated with descriptive phrases or simple affiliations (e.g., \"companion to Noork\"). It lacks a directive to capture a character's *agency*, *goals*, or *decisions*, which are vital for understanding their \"role.\" The prompt could be more specific about what kinds of properties are desired, such as \"actions taken,\" \"decisions made,\" or \"stated motivations.\"\n\n3.  **Limited Implicit Connection Handling:** The prompt's structure for relationship extraction is primarily pairwise and explicit. It struggles to capture implicit connections or the *implications* of relationships. The loyalty of \"Vasads to Gurn\" is noted but not explored for its strategic importance or Gurn's potential influence. The prompt doesn't encourage inferring connections based on context across different text segments.\n\n4.  **Weak Linkage of Status to Narrative Function:** Gurn's status as an \"exile from Grath\" is extracted but its narrative significance or how it might inform his actions and role is not emphasized by the prompt. The prompt needs to guide the LLM to consider how statuses might influence behavior or plot.\n\n5.  **Lack of Focus on \"Role\" Synthesis:** The prompt asks for \"entities\" and \"relationships,\" but the subsequent community summarization and retrieval are where \"role\" synthesis is needed. The graph extraction itself should ideally lay a better foundation for this synthesis by capturing more dynamic information. The current prompt, by focusing on static attributes, makes it harder for downstream components to answer a query about \"role.\"\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Incorporate Action-Oriented Extraction:** Modify the prompt to explicitly ask for extracted \"actions\" or \"events\" associated with entities. For example, a new category could be `actions: [{ verb: \"commands\", object: \"Vasads\", description: \"Gurn orders the Vasads.\" }]`.\n\n2.  **Refine \"Properties\" to Include Agency:** Expand the definition of \"properties\" to encourage capturing dynamic traits. Suggest properties like `motivations: \"Seeking redemption.\"`, `decisions: \"Chose to exile himself.\"`, `strategic_positioning: \"Leverages loyalty of Vasads.\"`.\n\n3.  **Prompt for Inferred or Contextual Relationships:** Add a directive to identify and describe *potential* or *implied* relationships, especially where loyalty or affiliation is mentioned. Include instructions like \"If an entity is loyal to another, consider what actions or influence this loyalty implies and document them.\"\n\n4.  **Emphasize Narrative Significance of Statuses:** When extracting properties or relationships, prompt the LLM to consider *why* a status is relevant. For instance, for \"exile,\" prompt to look for connections like \"exile from X led to Y action\" or \"exile from X influences Z motivation.\"\n\n5.  **Add a \"Role/Function\" Field (Optional but beneficial):** Consider a top-level field for key entities that explicitly asks for their narrative role, if strongly indicated in the text. This could be a short, synthesized statement derived from their actions and relationships.\n\nBy integrating these changes, the graph construction prompt can produce richer, more dynamic knowledge graphs that better support complex queries about character roles and implicit narrative connections.",
      "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the community selection process for the query \"What is Gurn's role in the story?\":\n\nThe current community selection prompt and the agent's execution demonstrate a significant weakness in granular relevance assessment and a tendency towards over-generalization, leading to the inclusion of noisy and tangential information.\n\n**Key Issues:**\n\n1.  **Superficial Keyword Matching:** The agent appears to rely too heavily on keywords and broad thematic similarities rather than direct relevance to the query entity, \"Gurn.\"\n    *   **Community 0** is correctly identified because it *explicitly* mentions Gurn, his relationship to Tholon Sarna, and his association with Noork. This is the crucial element of direct relevance.\n    *   **Community 7** is selected due to the mention of \"Sarna,\" but this \"Sarna\" is specified as \"daughter of Tholon Dist,\" creating ambiguity and a false connection to Tholon Sarna (Gurn's sister) from Community 0. The selection overlooks the critical difference in identity and the lack of any mention of Gurn.\n    *   **Communities 8, 9, and 10** are selected based on general themes like \"temple,\" \"conflict,\" and \"warriors.\" These are far too generic. The summaries do not contain any mention of Gurn or any specific actions or relationships that would shed light on *his* role. For instance, \"warriors\" in Community 10 offers no specific information about Gurn.\n\n2.  **Lack of Prioritization of Direct Character Information:** The prompt did not sufficiently guide the agent to prioritize information that *directly* describes Gurn's actions, relationships, or status (e.g., \"exile from Grath,\" \"companion\" to Noork, \"brother\" to Tholon Sarna, as provided in Community 0). Instead, it allowed for the inclusion of communities with only distant or implied connections.\n\n3.  **Introduction of Ambiguity and Distraction:** The inclusion of Community 7, with its potentially confused \"Sarna\" reference, directly hinders precise entity resolution. The other selected communities (8, 9, 10) add noise and distract the subsequent answer generation LLM with irrelevant details about temple hierarchy or generic combat scenarios.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Strengthen Direct Entity Mentions:** Explicitly instruct the agent to prioritize communities that *name* the query entity (Gurn) or describe his direct actions, relationships, or attributes.\n2.  **Enforce Granular Relevance:** The prompt should guide the agent to assess *how* each community's content specifically contributes to understanding \"Gurn's role.\" A low bar like \"mentions warriors\" is insufficient.\n3.  **Discourage Tangential Thematic Links:** Clearly state that general themes or loosely associated keywords are not sufficient justification for selection if the query entity is not directly involved.\n4.  **Prioritize Role-Defining Information:** The prompt could ask the agent to consider if a community describes Gurn's \"actions, relationships, motivations, or status.\"\n\nBy refining the prompt to emphasize direct relevance and character involvement, the agent can be steered towards selecting only the most pertinent communities, such as Community 0, leading to a more focused and accurate answer.",

Consider explicitly stating that speculative phrasing should be avoided if the information isn't directly supported.\n\n2.  **Handling of Tangential or Unclear Information:**\n    *   **Issue:** The prompt instructed to \"handle incomplete information\" and \"focus on relevance.\" However, the generated answer included the \"New York\" connection, which was obscure and detracted from Gurn's primary role, suggesting the prompt didn't sufficiently guide the LLM on *how* to discern and handle such details.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Enhance the prompt with a guideline like: \"If a piece of retrieved information seems tangential, obscure, or is not clearly linked to the character's primary role or motivations within the narrative, prioritize omitting it or briefly mentioning it only if it directly supports a core aspect of their role. Avoid extensive speculation on such details.\"\n\n3.  **Lack of Explicit Prioritization within the Answer Structure:**\n    *   **Issue:** The prompt outlined several aspects to focus on (actions, motivations, relationships, impact), but it didn't explicitly guide the LLM to *start* with the most defining aspects of the character's role and then elaborate. The current answer introduced Gurn and then immediately jumped to his sister, which is good, but could be structured more deliberately.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Refine the \"Instructions for Answering\" to suggest an order or hierarchy. For example: \"Begin by clearly stating the character's primary function or role in the story. Then, elaborate on the key elements supporting this role, such as their most significant motivations, relationships, and actions. Conclude by summarizing their overall impact.\"\n\n4.  **Potential for Redundancy:**\n    *   **Issue:** The prompt's general instruction to \"Synthesize Information\" and \"Connect related pieces of information\" is generally good, but without a specific check for direct repetition, it can lead to sentences that restate the same idea (e.g., \"Gurn's actions and motivations are directly linked to this rescue mission\" after already establishing the connection).\n    *   **Suggestion:** Add a meta-instruction like: \"Ensure each sentence adds new information or elaborates on a previous point without direct repetition of already stated facts.\"\n\nIn summary, the prompt needs to be more directive about **prioritization, conciseness, and judicious inclusion/exclusion of information**, especially when that information is not clearly central to the character's defined role. This will help the LLM generate answers that are more focused and impactful, leading to better ROUGE scores and a more efficient retrieval system.",
