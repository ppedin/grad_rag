# Logging Improvements for Enhanced Testing Experience

The logging system has been significantly improved to provide better readability and reduce information overload during testing and development.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Concise Message Formatting**
- **Before**: Long, verbose messages that cluttered the console
- **After**: Structured, truncated messages with essential information

```bash
# OLD STYLE (Verbose)
Generated answer for QA pair test_q1: This is a very long generated answer that would normally clog up the console output with unnecessary details when what we really need is just a preview to understand what's happening in the system during training...

# NEW STYLE (Concise)
03:58:27 | [QA: test_q1] Generated answer | Content: This is a very long generated answer that would normally clog up the console output with...
```

### 2. **Structured Information Display**
All log messages now follow consistent patterns:

**Agent Actions:**
```
[HyperparametersGraph] LLM recommendation | chunk_size=512 | confidence=0.85 | reasoning=The reasoning behind this chunk size...
```

**QA Processing:**
```
[QA: test_q1] Generated answer | Content: This is the generated response...
[QA: test_q1] Evaluation completed | Content: The evaluation shows good performance...
```

**Batch Progress:**
```
[Batch 1, Rep 1/3] Starting hyperparameters selection
[Batch 1, Rep 2/3] Graph construction completed | 45 entities, 78 relationships extracted
[Batch 2, Rep 3/3] Training completed | Final ROUGE: 0.73, Improvement: +12%
```

**Critique Results:**
```
[ANSWER_GENERATOR_GRAPH] Critique generated | Status: FROZEN - SKIPPED | Preview: This is a detailed critique...
[GRAPH_BUILDER] Critique generated | Status: UPDATED | Preview: This critique provides feedback on...
```

### 3. **Message Truncation by Type**

Different message types have appropriate length limits:

| Message Type | Max Length | Purpose |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| `generated_answer` | 100 chars | Preview of generated responses |
| `evaluation_result` | 100 chars | Summary of evaluation feedback |
| `prompt_content` | 150 chars | Prompt template previews |
| `critique` | 120 chars | Critique summaries |
| `reasoning` | 100 chars | Agent reasoning previews |
| `context` | 200 chars | Retrieved context summaries |
| `question` | 80 chars | Question text |
| `graph_description` | 150 chars | Graph structure summaries |

### 4. **Clear Status Indicators**

**Frozen Prompt Status:**
- `Status: FROZEN - SKIPPED` - Prompt is frozen, update skipped
- `Status: UPDATED` - Prompt was updated normally

**Batch Progress:**
- `[Batch X, Rep Y/Z]` - Clear progress tracking
- Action descriptions with relevant metrics

### 5. **Consistent Timestamps**
- Short format: `HH:MM:SS` for better readability
- Avoids date clutter for session logs

## Testing Benefits

### 1. **Improved Readability**
- Essential information visible at a glance
- Reduced visual clutter
- Easier to follow training progress

### 2. **Better Debugging**
- Clear agent identification
- Structured parameter display
- Easy to spot frozen vs. learning agents

### 3. **Progress Tracking**
- Batch and repetition context always visible
- Key metrics displayed inline
- Status updates are clear and informative

### 4. **Console Output Management**
- No more scrolling through walls of text
- Important information highlighted
- Consistent formatting across all agents

## Usage in Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Training Monitoring
```bash
python train_system.py --dataset squality --system graph --repetitions 3

# Sample Output:
[Batch 1, Rep 1/3] Starting hyperparameters selection
[HyperparametersGraph] LLM recommendation | chunk_size=512 | confidence=0.85
[QA: sq_001] Generated answer | Content: The main issue facing the company is...
[ANSWER_GENERATOR_GRAPH] Critique generated | Status: UPDATED | Preview: The response accurately identifies...
[Batch 1, Rep 2/3] Graph construction completed | 45 entities, 78 relationships extracted
```

### Scenario 2: Frozen Prompts Testing
```bash
python train_system.py --dataset narrativeqa --system vector --freeze-prompts hyperparameters_vector,answer_generator_vector

# Sample Output:
[HyperparametersVector] LLM recommendation | chunk_size=256 | confidence=0.92
[HYPERPARAMETERS_VECTOR] Critique generated | Status: FROZEN - SKIPPED | Preview: The chunk size selection considers...
[ANSWER_GENERATOR_VECTOR] Critique generated | Status: FROZEN - SKIPPED | Preview: The answer generation approach...
[VECTOR_RETRIEVAL_PLANNER] Critique generated | Status: UPDATED | Preview: The retrieval strategy shows good...
```

### Scenario 3: Error and Warning Detection
```bash
# Clear indicators for issues:
[ERROR] Graph builder agent not available, using fallback
[WARN] Cross-system prompt detected: 'hyperparameters_vector' for graph system
[INFO] Missing prompt file: graph_builder_prompt.txt
```

## Implementation Details

### LoggingUtils Class
Central utility for consistent logging with:
- Message truncation by type
- Structured formatting methods
- Agent action formatting
- QA processing logs
- Batch progress tracking
- Critique result formatting

### Integration Points
- **GraphRAG System**: All agents updated with new logging
- **VectorRAG System**: All agents updated with new logging
- **Training Script**: Improved progress and status reporting
- **Frozen Prompts**: Clear status indication throughout

### File Locations
- **Logging Utilities**: `logging_utils.py`
- **Test Script**: `test_logging.py`
- **Implementation**: Updated in `multi_agent_system.py` and `multi_agent_system_vector.py`

## Testing the Improvements

Run the logging test to see before/after comparison:

```bash
python test_logging.py
```

This demonstrates:
- Old verbose vs. new concise logging
- Message truncation examples
- Structured formatting benefits
- Progress tracking improvements

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality preserved
- Log files still contain complete information
- Console output is improved without losing data
- Configuration options remain the same

The improvements focus on **readability** and **usability** during testing while maintaining all the detailed logging capabilities for analysis and debugging.
