He is a skilled warrior with a keen sense of hearing and a knack for combat. Noork encounters a girl named Tholon Sarna, who is referred to as the \"golden girl\" and is a captive.\n\nThe central conflict appears to revolve around the rescue of Tholon Sarna and other captured women from a temple dedicated to a god named Uzdon. These women are intended for sacrifice, with one chosen daily by the High Priest. The temple is guarded by \"Misty Ones\" and priests, who seem to have magical or special abilities, such as robes of invisibility and a \"sacred window of Uzdon.\"\n\nNoork, with the help of a slave named Rold and information about the temple's layout and rituals, infiltrates the temple. He battles guards and priests, using his combat skills and disguises (donning cloaks and robes to blend in). A significant event is Noork's confrontation with a priest at the prison pit where Tholon Sarna is held. He defeats the priest, rescues Tholon Sarna, and they escape together, with Noork possibly intending to take her to the city of Grath.\n\nThe context also briefly mentions an earlier event where warriors of Bis fell upon slavers, and a group escaped, only to be trailed by the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull. Noork expresses a desire to visit the island of the Misty Ones. The story also touches upon the origins of Noork, who recalls \"New York,\" suggesting he is not from this world.\n\nThe provided context does not fully detail the ultimate resolution of Noork's quest or his larger motivations beyond rescuing Sarna and his curiosity about the Misty Ones. It is also unclear if he successfully rescues all the captured women or if he fulfills his promise to Rold.", "generated_answer_length": 1766, "rouge_scores": {"rouge_1": 0.17446270543615677, "rouge_2": 0.14829329962073326, "rouge_l": 0.17446270543615677}, "execution_time_seconds": 10.971954, "hyperparameters": {"chunk_size": 256}, "intermediate_outputs": {"hyperparameters": {"chunk_size": 256, "processing_time_ms": 1327.769, "learned_prompt_used": false}, "retrieval": {"query": "What is the plot of the story?", "retrieved_context_length": 21660, "processing_time_ms": 0}, "answer_generation": {"generated_answer_length": 1766, "processing_time_ms": 0}, "evaluation": {"rouge_score": 0.17446270543615677, "processing_time_ms": 0}, "vector_building": {"chunk_size": 256, "faiss_index_path": "vector_indexes\\squality_test_batch_0.index", "vectors_created": true, "embedding_method": "openai", "processing_time_ms": 433.849}}, "system_specific_metrics": {"chunk_size": 256, "total_chunks": 24, "faiss_index_path": "vector_indexes\\squality_test_batch_0.index", "retrieved_context_length": 21660, "embedding_dimension": 1536}}
