When they speak, they learn that Noork has been living with her brother, Gurn.  With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.  He fights the priest, kills him, and frees Sarna.  They go back to the field, get Rold, and the three of them flee into the jungle.  They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle."], "document_text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\nRaiders of the Second Moon\nBy GENE ELLERMAN\nA strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny worldâ€”to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBeyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrichâ€”whose memory was\ngone completelyâ€”again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood womanâ€”and ugly, my son.\"\n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metalâ€”gold, silver and brassâ€”vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshippedâ€”mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyesâ€”-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchangedâ€”thickenedâ€”as he saw the features of Noork.\n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Raiders of the Second Moon, by Gene Ellerman\n\n", "document_length": 33709, "total_iterations": 2, "metadata": {"batch_id": 0, "dataset": "squality", "setting": "test"}}

This can lead to:\n    *   **Incomplete Information:** Crucial context, motivations, or consequences might be split across chunks, resulting in fragmented entities and relationships extracted by the LLM.\n    *   **Loss of Context:** Extracted graph elements may lack the necessary context to understand their significance or interconnectedness, hindering the identification of causal and temporal links.\n\n2.  **Graph Sparsity and Noise for Plot:** Overly small chunks can result in a sparse graph where important plot progressions are obscured due to lost connections between fragmented pieces. Relationships spanning chunk boundaries are likely to be missed or misrepresented.\n\n**Recommendations for Optimal `chunk_size`:**\n\n1.  **Increase `chunk_size` for Narrative Cohesion:** Prioritize a larger `chunk_size`. This increases the likelihood that a complete narrative event, dialogue, or plot development is contained within a single chunk. This leads to more comprehensive and contextually rich graph extractions. Experiment with values in the range of **400-800 words**, adjusting based on the text's complexity and narrative density.\n\n2.  **Consider Overlapping Chunks:** To mitigate information loss at boundaries, implement overlapping chunks. This ensures adjacent context is available for graph extraction, improving continuity. A typical overlap might be **10-20% of the `chunk_size`**.\n\n3.  **Prioritize Semantic Chunking (if applicable):** When possible, favor chunking strategies that align with semantic boundaries (e.g., paragraphs, scene changes, chapters) over fixed word counts to naturally group related narrative elements.\n\n**Your Objective:**\n\nWhen presented with a text, critically evaluate the described narrative characteristics and recommend an optimal `chunk_size` (and potential overlap) that best supports the extraction of a coherent, plot-driven graph. Justify your recommendation by referencing the potential impact on narrative cohesion, context preservation, and the completeness of extracted entities and relationships.

Your goal is to construct a retrieval plan that effectively explores a knowledge graph to answer user queries. You must go beyond superficial entity extraction and focus on understanding the relational structure of the graph to construct a coherent answer.\n\n**Core Principles for Retrieval Planning:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relational Exploration:** When you identify key entities (nodes), your primary next step should be to explore their *relationships* (edges) using `get_neighbors(node_id, relationship_types=None)`. Do not simply extract more entities without understanding their connections.\n\n2.  **Infer Concepts from Relationships:** Abstract concepts like \"plot,\" \"conflict,\" \"motivation,\" or \"journey\" are not typically found as direct node labels. You must infer these by analyzing the *types* of relationships between entities. For example:\n    *   `travels to` relationships can indicate a journey.\n    *   `attacked`, `killed`, `betrayed` relationships signal conflict and turning points.\n    *   `interacts with`, `helps`, `hinders` relationships reveal character dynamics and plot progression.\n    *   If motivation is present, look for relationships like `desires`, `aims to achieve`, `wants to save`.\n\n3.  **Strategic Graph Traversal:** Plan your exploration sequentially. After identifying initial entities, trace their connections to understand their roles and actions within the narrative or topic. Use the information gathered at each step to inform the next.\n\n4.  **Avoid Literal Keyword Searches for Abstract Concepts:** Do not use `search_nodes_by_keyword('plot')` or similar broad, literal searches for abstract narrative elements. Instead, *construct* an understanding of the plot by piecing together events, character actions, and their causal or sequential relationships.\n\n5.  **Leverage Specific Node and Relationship Types:** Pay close attention to the `node_types` and `relationship_types` available in the graph schema. Use these specific labels to guide your search and exploration for relevant information that directly contributes to answering the query.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nGiven a user query, generate a sequence of retrieval actions. Each action should be a call to one of the following functions:\n*   `search_nodes_by_keyword(keyword: str, limit: int = 10)`: Use this for specific, concrete entities or well-defined concepts that are likely to be node labels or properties.\n*   `get_neighbors(node_id: str, relationship_types: Optional[List[str]] = None, limit: int = 10)`: **This is your primary tool for understanding relationships and plot.** Use this after identifying relevant nodes.\n*   `get_node_details(node_id: str)`: Use this to retrieve properties of a specific node when its ID is known.\n\nYour plan should be a Python list of function calls, ensuring that each step logically builds upon the previous one to gather information necessary to answer the query by understanding the graph's relational structure. Focus on building a narrative or causal chain of events.", "learned_prompt_graph_builder": "You are an expert knowledge graph constructor specializing in extracting narrative structures from text. Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

For example, a crucial dialogue between characters, a detailed description of an important event, or the setup and resolution of a conflict might be split across multiple chunks. This fragmentation can lead to:\n    *   **Incomplete Information per Chunk:** When an LLM extracts a graph from a 200-word chunk, it may only see a portion of a larger event or interaction. This can result in incomplete or misleading entities and relationships being extracted. For instance, a character's motivation might be stated in one chunk, while the action resulting from that motivation is in another.\n    *   **Loss of Context:** The relationships extracted might lack the necessary context to understand their significance. A character performing an action might be identified, but the reason *why* they are performing it, or the immediate consequence, might be absent due to being in a different chunk. This hinders the extraction of causal and temporal links.\n\n2.  **Increased Graph Sparsity and Noise for Plot:** While a larger chunk size can sometimes introduce noise, a very small chunk size like 200 is more likely to lead to a graph that is *too sparse* in terms of meaningful plot progression.\n    *   **Over-fragmented Relationships:** Relationships that span across chunk boundaries will be lost or incompletely represented. For example, a \"travels to\" relationship might be partially captured, or the full journey and its purpose might be obscured.\n    *   **Dilution of Important Entities/Relationships:** If key plot drivers are split, the resulting nodes and edges might appear less connected or significant than they truly are in the narrative. The LLM might struggle to connect fragmented pieces into a coherent plot summary.\n\n**Recommendations for Chunk Size Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Increase Chunk Size for Narrative Cohesion:** Consider increasing the chunk size. A larger chunk size (e.g., 400-600 words, or even larger depending on testing) would increase the likelihood that a single, important narrative event, character interaction, or plot development is contained within a single chunk. This would allow the LLM to extract more complete and contextually rich graphs for each segment.\n    *   **Benefit:** This would directly address the \"Lack of Granularity in Plot Elements\" and \"Potential for Over-Specificity and Noise\" issues mentioned in the critique, by ensuring that more plot-critical information is grouped together.\n\n2.  **Experiment with Overlapping Chunks:** Even with a larger chunk size, consider implementing overlapping chunks. This can help to mitigate information loss at the boundaries of chunks, ensuring that context from adjacent segments is available during graph extraction.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Chunking (Advanced):** If possible, explore dynamic chunking strategies. Instead of a fixed size, chunks could be determined by semantic breaks in the text, such as chapter divisions, paragraph boundaries, or scene changes. This would naturally group related narrative elements.\n\nBy increasing the chunk size, the system has a better chance of capturing meaningful narrative arcs within each chunk, leading to a more coherent and useful graph for understanding the plot.", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the provided graph construction prompt, aimed at improving its effectiveness for narrative understanding:\n\n**Critique of the Graph Construction Prompt:**\n\nThe current prompt is a good starting point for extracting entities and relationships but lacks the specificity needed to build a graph that effectively supports narrative analysis, such as answering \"What is the plot of the story?\".\n\n1.  **Insufficient Focus on Narrative Structure:** The prompt asks for entities and relationships but doesn't explicitly guide the LLM to prioritize *narrative progression*. Key plot elements like sequence of events, cause-and-effect, character goals, motivations, and outcomes are not emphasized. The broad request for relationships, while capturing connections, doesn't guarantee the identification of those critical for storytelling.\n\n2.  **Ambiguity and Over-Generalization of Relationships:**\n    *   **Broad Relationship Types:** Many extracted relationship types are very general (e.g., \"associated with,\" \"interacts with,\" \"in\"). While factually correct, they don't convey the *nature* of the interaction or association crucial for plot comprehension. For instance, \"associated with\" could mean many things (friendship, rivalry, collaboration, proximity).\n    *   **Redundancy and Overlap:** The sample output shows numerous relationship types that appear to be synonymous or highly overlapping (e.g., \"in,\" \"located in,\" \"lives in/associated with,\" \"residence,\" \"located on,\" \"satellite of\"). This creates noise and makes it harder to identify the core narrative connections.\n    *   **Lack of Action/Event Focus:** The prompt doesn't specifically ask for relationships that represent actions, events, or transformations, which are the building blocks of a plot.\n\n3.  **Lack of Granularity in Entity Properties:** While the prompt asks for properties, it doesn't guide the LLM to extract properties that are narratively significant. For example, character traits, motivations, or the state/condition of objects/locations at specific points in the narrative are often crucial for understanding the plot.\n\n4.  **Absence of Temporal or Causal Information:** Plots unfold over time and involve causality. The current prompt does not prompt the LLM to extract or represent temporal ordering of events or explicit causal links between actions and consequences.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Emphasize Narrative Actions and Events:** Explicitly instruct the LLM to identify and represent *actions* performed by entities and *events* that occur. Prompt for relationships that describe \"who did what to whom,\" \"what happened as a result,\" and \"what are the main goals/conflicts.\"\n\n2.  **Define More Specific Relationship Types:** Guide the LLM to use or create more descriptive relationship types. For example, instead of just \"interacts with,\" prompt for \"helps,\" \"hinders,\" \"fights,\" \"communicates,\" \"travels to,\" \"uses,\" \"achieves,\" \"fails,\" etc. Consider a hierarchy where general types can be specialized.\n\n3.  **Incorporate Temporal and Causal Markers:** If possible, encourage the extraction of information that indicates sequence or causality. This could be through specific relationship types (e.g., \"leads to,\" \"causes,\" \"precedes\") or by asking for explicit descriptions of how events are linked.\n\n4.  **Focus on Key Narrative Elements:** Instruct the LLM to identify entities and relationships that are central to the main storyline, protagonist's journey, conflicts, and resolutions. This might involve prioritizing relationships involving main characters or significant plot points.\n\n5.  **Refine Property Extraction:** Guide the LLM to extract properties that reveal character motivations, traits, or the changing state of narrative elements. For example, \"Noork's memory erased\" is a critical state change.", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The provided retrieval plans show a significant disconnect between the agent's strategy and the actual graph exploration capabilities. The core problem lies in the agent's inability to move beyond superficial node identification and delve into the relational structure required to answer a query about the \"plot.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the issues and recommendations:\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Superficial Entity Extraction without Relation:** The initial plans focus heavily on identifying entities (e.g., \"Person\" nodes). While important, simply listing characters or locations does not constitute understanding a plot. The plans consistently fail to incorporate steps that explore the *relationships* between these entities. The graph, as described, is rich with relationship types that are crucial for narrative understanding (e.g., \"interacts with,\" \"travels to,\" \"attacked,\" \"killed\"), yet these are largely ignored.\n\n2.  **Ineffective Search Strategy for \"Plot\":** The repeated use of `search_nodes_by_keyword('plot')` is a reactive and likely ineffective strategy. A plot is not typically a single node labeled \"plot.\" Instead, it's an emergent property of character actions, events, and their connections. The agent should be *constructing* an understanding of the plot through relational exploration, not searching for a literal keyword.\n\n3.  **Lack of Depth in Exploration:** The plans do not demonstrate a strategic approach to traversing the graph to piece together a narrative. For instance, once \"Person\" nodes are identified, the logical next step would be to `get_neighbors` for key characters to understand their immediate connections and actions. The plans lack this sequential, deductive reasoning.\n\n4.  **Underutilization of Graph Properties:** The graph description highlights various entity and relationship types. The retrieval plans do not show any attempt to leverage these specific types to infer plot points. For example, searching for `travels to` relationships could reveal journey arcs, while `attacked` or `killed` relationships signal conflict and turning points.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relational Exploration:** The prompt needs to guide the agent to actively explore relationships between identified entities. Encourage using `get_neighbors` on key entities and then examining the *types* of relationships to infer plot elements.\n2.  **Develop Narrative-Driven Strategies:** Instead of searching for \"plot,\" the agent should be prompted to identify key actors, their motivations (if discernible from relationship types like \"desire,\" \"aims to save\"), and the sequence of their interactions or significant events.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement of Understanding:** Encourage the agent to use information from previous steps. If a character is identified, the next step should be to explore their connections, not just list more entities.\n4.  **Leverage Specific Relationship Types:** Prompt the agent to consider relationship types that are indicative of plot progression (e.g., actions, conflicts, travel, motivations). The prompt should emphasize using these to build a coherent story.\n5.  **Avoid Literal Keyword Searches for Abstract Concepts:** Train the agent to infer concepts like \"plot\" from structural graph information rather than seeking a direct keyword match.", "answer_generation_critique": "The current prompt for the answer generation LLM is too generic and lacks the necessary guidance to produce helpful and user-centric responses when information is insufficient.\n\n**Critique of the Current Prompt:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Persona/Role Definition:** The prompt doesn't assign a specific role or persona to the LLM. Phrases like \"You will be given...\" and \"Your goal is to use...\" are functional but don't encourage a conversational or helpful assistant-like demeanor. This contributes to the bluntness of the \"I am sorry, but I cannot provide...\" response.\n2.  **No Guidance on Handling Insufficient Information:** The prompt is designed for scenarios where information *is* present and sufficient. It offers no instructions on how the LLM should behave when the retrieved context *doesn't* directly answer the query. This leaves the LLM to its default behavior, which in this case, is to state the limitation directly.\n3.  **Absence of Instructions for Alternative Actions:** Crucially, the prompt doesn't instruct the LLM to offer alternative actions, ask clarifying questions, or suggest ways the user might rephrase their query or request different types of information. This is the core weakness highlighted by the feedback, preventing the system from being helpful.\n4.  **No Emphasis on User Experience:** The prompt's focus is solely on answering the query *using the provided information*. It doesn't prioritize the user's overall experience, which includes being guided towards a solution even when the initial attempt fails.\n5.  **Implicit Assumption of Direct Answerability:** The prompt implicitly assumes that the provided \"information\" will directly map to an answer. It doesn't account for situations where the information is related but not directly answering, or where it's of a different format (like graph data vs. narrative text).\n\n**Suggestions for Prompt Improvement:**\n\nTo address these issues and align with the feedback, the prompt should be significantly enhanced to:\n\n1.  **Define a Helpful Assistant Persona:** Instruct the LLM to act as a helpful and understanding assistant.\n2.  **Provide Explicit Instructions for Handling Insufficient Information:**\n    *   **Acknowledge Limitation Clearly but Politely:** Similar to the current response, but framed within the assistant persona.\n    *   **Explain *Why* (in user-friendly terms):** Guide the LLM to explain that the retrieved information (e.g., graph data) doesn't contain narrative plot details, using analogies if possible.\n    *   **Offer Concrete Next Steps/Alternatives:** This is the most critical addition. The prompt should instruct the LLM to suggest:\n        *   Searching for a plot summary using different methods.\n        *   Providing information about characters/relationships if that's of interest.\n        *   Asking the user if they'd like to refine their search.\n3.  **Emphasize User-Centricity:** Explicitly state that the goal is not just to answer, but to assist the user in achieving their objective, even if it requires alternative approaches.\n4.  **Guide Explanation of Retrieved Context:** If the retrieved context is a graph, the prompt should prompt the LLM to explain this simply before stating its limitations regarding narrative.\n\nBy incorporating these points, the prompt can be transformed from a simple data-mapping instruction to one that fosters a more interactive, helpful, and user-friendly RAG system.", "graph_builder_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text.

The information only lists potential characters and relationships within a graph\" might be a bit too technical for a general user.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\nThe goal is to make the response more user-centric and proactive.\n\n1.  **Offer to Search Again/Provide Different Information:** The most significant improvement would be to acknowledge the user's intent and offer to try a different approach or provide related information that *is* available.\n\n2.  **Clarify the Nature of the \"Graph\":** If the system retrieved a \"graph,\" it's worth explaining what that means in a simpler way, or at least acknowledging that this kind of data isn't narrative.\n\n3.  **Suggest Next Steps for the User:** Empower the user by suggesting how they might find the plot.\n\n**Improved Response Examples:**\n\nHere are a few options, ranging from a slightly better to a significantly improved response:\n\n**Option 1 (Slightly Better):**\n\n> \"I apologize, but the information I found doesn't include the plot of the story. It seems to be a list of characters and their connections, like a relationship map, rather than a narrative description of events. Would you like me to try searching for a plot summary instead?\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** Uses simpler language (\"relationship map\") and directly asks if the user wants a different kind of search.\n\n**Option 2 (More Helpful & Transparent):**\n\n> \"I'm sorry, I couldn't find the plot of the story in the information I retrieved. The data I have focuses on identifying characters and their relationships, almost like a character web or family tree, but it doesn't describe the sequence of events or the story's narrative.\n>\n> If you'd like, I can try to:\n> *   **Search for a plot summary** using different keywords.\n> *   **Provide details about the characters and their relationships** if you're interested in that aspect.\n>\n> Please let me know how you'd like to proceed!\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:**\n    *   Uses analogies like \"character web\" or \"family tree\" for better understanding.\n    *   Clearly lists actionable options for the user.\n    *   Invites further interaction and collaboration.\n\n**Option 3 (Most Proactive - if the system has context or can infer):**\n\n> \"I was able to find information about the characters and how they are connected within a story, but unfortunately, the details about the actual plot â€“ what happens in the story â€“ are missing from my current data.\n>\n> To help you better, would you like me to:\n> 1.  **Search for a plot summary of this story**?\n> 2.  **Tell you more about the characters and their relationships**?\n> 3.  **Try to guess the genre or themes** based on the character connections (if that's possible)?\n>\n> Please tell me what would be most useful!\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:**\n    *   Explains the limitation clearly.\n    *   Offers concrete, specific actions.\n    *   Includes a speculative option (if the system has capabilities for it) to show more advanced functionality.\n\n**Key Principles for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Empathy:** Acknowledge the user's goal.\n*   **Clarity:** Use simple language.\n*   **Actionability:** Offer concrete next steps or alternative actions.\n*   **Transparency:** Explain *what* was retrieved and *why* it's insufficient, but do so in an understandable way.\n*   **User Control:** Give the user options on how to proceed.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can transform from a simple \"I can't\" response to a helpful assistant that guides the user towards their desired outcome, even when the initial retrieval fails.", "repetition": 0, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:17:19.294546"}}

Therefore, I cannot provide a plot summary for any story,\" indicates a fundamental misunderstanding or a lack of relevant information.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why the response is problematic and how it can be improved:\n\n**Problems with the Current Response:**\n\n1.  **Misinterpretation of \"The Story\":** The system assumes \"the story\" refers to a story *within* its knowledge graph or retrieved documents. When it finds no such story data, it concludes there's nothing to summarize. It doesn't consider that the user might be referring to a story *outside* of the RAG system's immediate context, or that the system itself might be the \"story\" in a metaphorical sense (e.g., the story of how the system operates).\n2.  **Over-reliance on a Specific Data Structure (\"Graph\"):** The mention of an \"empty graph\" suggests the system's retrieval mechanism or internal representation is heavily tied to graph data. If the user's query isn't directly mappable to this structure, the system fails completely. This isn't user-friendly.\n3.  **Lack of Clarification or Guidance:** Instead of just stating it can't help, the response could guide the user on how to get help. The suggestion \"If you have information about a specific story or a knowledge graph that contains details about plots, please provide it\" is a good start, but it's still very technical (\"knowledge graph\").\n4.  **Abrupt and Unhelpful:** While polite, the response doesn't try to bridge the gap or offer alternative interpretations.\n\n**How to Improve the Response:**\n\nThe core issue is the system's inability to understand the user's intent when its direct data source is empty. The improvement should focus on:\n*   **Clarifying the ambiguity:** Ask the user for more context.\n*   **Acknowledging limitations gracefully:** Explain *why* it can't answer, but do so in simpler terms.\n*   **Providing actionable next steps:** Guide the user on how to rephrase their query or provide the necessary information.\n\nHere are several improved response options, ranging from simple to more sophisticated:\n\n**Improvement Option 1 (More Direct Clarification):**\n\n> \"I can't seem to find any information about a specific story in my current data. Could you please tell me which story you're interested in? If you can provide the title or a brief description, I'll try my best to find its plot for you.\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** Directly asks for clarification about *which* story. Avoids technical jargon like \"graph.\"\n\n**Improvement Option 2 (Acknowledging Potential Lack of Data and Guiding):**\n\n> \"I'm sorry, but I don't have any specific story details or plot information available right now. To help me understand what you're looking for, could you please:\n>\n> 1.  **Specify the story:** What is the title of the story you're interested in?\n> 2.  **Provide context:** Are you referring to a story discussed earlier, or a specific book, movie, or event?\n>\n> Once I have more information, I'll do my best to find the plot summary for you.\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** More structured, offers clear options for the user, and explains *why* it needs more info.\n\n**Improvement Option 3 (Slightly More Empathetic and Flexible):**\n\n> \"It seems I'm missing the information needed to tell you the plot of 'the story.' My current knowledge doesn't contain details about any particular narrative.\n>\n> To help me assist you, could you please provide more context? For example:\n>\n> *   What is the name of the story?\n> *   Where might I find information about it (e.g., a book title, a movie, a previous conversation topic)?\n>\n> I'm ready to help if you can give me a bit more to go on!\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** Uses softer language (\"missing the information,\" \"narrative\"). Offers flexible examples of what \"context\" could mean.\n\n**Improvement Option 4 (If the RAG system *can* process external text):**\n\n> \"I don't have a specific story pre-loaded or indexed that I can summarize. However, if you can provide me with the text of the story, or tell me its title and where it comes from (like a book, movie, or website), I can try to process that information and tell you the plot.\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** Clearly states its limitations but also offers a path forward if the user can supply the data directly.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Improvement:**\n\n*   **User-Centric Language:** Avoid internal technical terms like \"graph,\" \"nodes,\" or \"connections\" unless absolutely necessary and explained.\n*   **Clarification is Key:** When ambiguity exists (like \"the story\"), ask clarifying questions.\n*   **Actionable Suggestions:** Guide the user on *how* they can get the answer they need.\n*   **Flexibility:** The system should be able to handle queries that don't perfectly map to its internal structure. It should try to infer user intent or ask for more data.\n\nThe original response failed because it treated the query as a direct data lookup and, upon finding no data, gave up.

The suggestion \"If you have information about a specific story or a knowledge graph that contains details about plots, please provide it\" is a good start, but it's still very technical (\"knowledge graph\").\n4.  **Abrupt and Unhelpful:** While polite, the response doesn't try to bridge the gap or offer alternative interpretations.\n\n**How to Improve the Response:**\n\nThe core issue is the system's inability to understand the user's intent when its direct data source is empty. The improvement should focus on:\n*   **Clarifying the ambiguity:** Ask the user for more context.\n*   **Acknowledging limitations gracefully:** Explain *why* it can't answer, but do so in simpler terms.\n*   **Providing actionable next steps:** Guide the user on how to rephrase their query or provide the necessary information.\n\nHere are several improved response options, ranging from simple to more sophisticated:\n\n**Improvement Option 1 (More Direct Clarification):**\n\n> \"I can't seem to find any information about a specific story in my current data. Could you please tell me which story you're interested in? If you can provide the title or a brief description, I'll try my best to find its plot for you.\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** Directly asks for clarification about *which* story. Avoids technical jargon like \"graph.\"\n\n**Improvement Option 2 (Acknowledging Potential Lack of Data and Guiding):**\n\n> \"I'm sorry, but I don't have any specific story details or plot information available right now. To help me understand what you're looking for, could you please:\n>\n> 1.  **Specify the story:** What is the title of the story you're interested in?\n> 2.  **Provide context:** Are you referring to a story discussed earlier, or a specific book, movie, or event?\n>\n> Once I have more information, I'll do my best to find the plot summary for you.\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** More structured, offers clear options for the user, and explains *why* it needs more info.\n\n**Improvement Option 3 (Slightly More Empathetic and Flexible):**\n\n> \"It seems I'm missing the information needed to tell you the plot of 'the story.' My current knowledge doesn't contain details about any particular narrative.\n>\n> To help me assist you, could you please provide more context? For example:\n>\n> *   What is the name of the story?\n> *   Where might I find information about it (e.g., a book title, a movie, a previous conversation topic)?\n>\n> I'm ready to help if you can give me a bit more to go on!\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** Uses softer language (\"missing the information,\" \"narrative\"). Offers flexible examples of what \"context\" could mean.\n\n**Improvement Option 4 (If the RAG system *can* process external text):**\n\n> \"I don't have a specific story pre-loaded or indexed that I can summarize. However, if you can provide me with the text of the story, or tell me its title and where it comes from (like a book, movie, or website), I can try to process that information and tell you the plot.\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** Clearly states its limitations but also offers a path forward if the user can supply the data directly.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Improvement:**\n\n*   **User-Centric Language:** Avoid internal technical terms like \"graph,\" \"nodes,\" or \"connections\" unless absolutely necessary and explained.\n*   **Clarification is Key:** When ambiguity exists (like \"the story\"), ask clarifying questions.\n*   **Actionable Suggestions:** Guide the user on *how* they can get the answer they need.\n*   **Flexibility:** The system should be able to handle queries that don't perfectly map to its internal structure. It should try to infer user intent or ask for more data.\n\nThe original response failed because it treated the query as a direct data lookup and, upon finding no data, gave up. An improved response would recognize the potential for misunderstanding or missing context and actively try to resolve it.", "repetition": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:18:04.915361"}}

This can lead to:\n    *   **Incomplete Information:** Crucial context, motivations, or consequences might be split across chunks, resulting in fragmented entities and relationships extracted by the LLM.\n    *   **Loss of Context:** Extracted graph elements may lack the necessary context to understand their significance or interconnectedness, hindering the identification of causal and temporal links.\n\n2.  **Graph Sparsity and Noise for Plot:** Overly small chunks can result in a sparse graph where important plot progressions are obscured due to lost connections between fragmented pieces. Relationships spanning chunk boundaries are likely to be missed or misrepresented.\n\n**Recommendations for Optimal `chunk_size`:**\n\n1.  **Increase `chunk_size` for Narrative Cohesion:** Prioritize a larger `chunk_size`. This increases the likelihood that a complete narrative event, dialogue, or plot development is contained within a single chunk. This leads to more comprehensive and contextually rich graph extractions. Experiment with values in the range of **400-800 words**, adjusting based on the text's complexity and narrative density.\n\n2.  **Consider Overlapping Chunks:** To mitigate information loss at boundaries, implement overlapping chunks. This ensures adjacent context is available for graph extraction, improving continuity. A typical overlap might be **10-20% of the `chunk_size`**.\n\n3.  **Prioritize Semantic Chunking (if applicable):** When possible, favor chunking strategies that align with semantic boundaries (e.g., paragraphs, scene changes, chapters) over fixed word counts to naturally group related narrative elements.\n\n**Your Objective:**\n\nWhen presented with a text, critically evaluate the described narrative characteristics and recommend an optimal `chunk_size` (and potential overlap) that best supports the extraction of a coherent, plot-driven graph.

You must go beyond superficial entity extraction and focus on understanding the relational structure of the graph to construct a coherent answer.\n\n**Core Principles for Retrieval Planning:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relational Exploration:** When you identify key entities (nodes), your primary next step should be to explore their *relationships* (edges) using `get_neighbors(node_id, relationship_types=None)`. Do not simply extract more entities without understanding their connections.\n\n2.  **Infer Concepts from Relationships:** Abstract concepts like \"plot,\" \"conflict,\" \"motivation,\" or \"journey\" are not typically found as direct node labels. You must infer these by analyzing the *types* of relationships between entities. For example:\n    *   `travels to` relationships can indicate a journey.\n    *   `attacked`, `killed`, `betrayed` relationships signal conflict and turning points.\n    *   `interacts with`, `helps`, `hinders` relationships reveal character dynamics and plot progression.\n    *   If motivation is present, look for relationships like `desires`, `aims to achieve`, `wants to save`.\n\n3.  **Strategic Graph Traversal:** Plan your exploration sequentially. After identifying initial entities, trace their connections to understand their roles and actions within the narrative or topic. Use the information gathered at each step to inform the next.\n\n4.  **Avoid Literal Keyword Searches for Abstract Concepts:** Do not use `search_nodes_by_keyword('plot')` or similar broad, literal searches for abstract narrative elements. Instead, *construct* an understanding of the plot by piecing together events, character actions, and their causal or sequential relationships.\n\n5.  **Leverage Specific Node and Relationship Types:** Pay close attention to the `node_types` and `relationship_types` available in the graph schema. Use these specific labels to guide your search and exploration for relevant information that directly contributes to answering the query.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nGiven a user query, generate a sequence of retrieval actions. Each action should be a call to one of the following functions:\n*   `search_nodes_by_keyword(keyword: str, limit: int = 10)`: Use this for specific, concrete entities or well-defined concepts that are likely to be node labels or properties.\n*   `get_neighbors(node_id: str, relationship_types: Optional[List[str]] = None, limit: int = 10)`: **This is your primary tool for understanding relationships and plot.** Use this after identifying relevant nodes.\n*   `get_node_details(node_id: str)`: Use this to retrieve properties of a specific node when its ID is known.\n\nYour plan should be a Python list of function calls, ensuring that each step logically builds upon the previous one to gather information necessary to answer the query by understanding the graph's relational structure.

Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest. This amulet allowed her to control time, which she used to prevent the dragon from attacking the village.\"\n\n*   **Entities:** Alice (Character), Magical Amulet (Object), Forbidden Forest (Location), Time (Concept), Dragon (Character), Village (Location).\n*   **Properties:**\n    *   (Alice, motivation, prevent dragon attack)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, ability, control time)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, state, found)\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   (Alice, FINDS, Magical Amulet)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, LOCATED_IN, Forbidden Forest)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, GRANTS_ABILITY, Alice) # Or (Alice, CONTROLS, Time)\n    *   (Alice, USES, Magical Amulet)\n    *   (Alice, PREVENTS, Dragon Attack) # Or (Alice, PREVENTS_ATTACK_BY(Dragon, Village))\n    *   (Dragon, ATTACKS, Village)\n\nBegin graph construction for the provided text.", "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chunk size of 200 appears to be a reasonable starting point, but it could be improved to enhance the graph's ability to capture narrative and plot details.\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (200):**\n\n1.  **Potential for Fragmenting Key Narrative Events:** A chunk size of 200 words might be too small to contain cohesive narrative arcs or significant plot points. For example, a crucial dialogue between characters, a detailed description of an important event, or the setup and resolution of a conflict might be split across multiple chunks. This fragmentation can lead to:\n    *   **Incomplete Information per Chunk:** When an LLM extracts a graph from a 200-word chunk, it may only see a portion of a larger event or interaction. This can result in incomplete or misleading entities and relationships being extracted. For instance, a character's motivation might be stated in one chunk, while the action resulting from that motivation is in another.\n    *   **Loss of Context:** The relationships extracted might lack the necessary context to understand their significance. A character performing an action might be identified, but the reason *why* they are performing it, or the immediate consequence, might be absent due to being in a different chunk. This hinders the extraction of causal and temporal links.\n\n2.  **Increased Graph Sparsity and Noise for Plot:** While a larger chunk size can sometimes introduce noise, a very small chunk size like 200 is more likely to lead to a graph that is *too sparse* in terms of meaningful plot progression.\n    *   **Over-fragmented Relationships:** Relationships that span across chunk boundaries will be lost or incompletely represented. For example, a \"travels to\" relationship might be partially captured, or the full journey and its purpose might be obscured.\n    *   **Dilution of Important Entities/Relationships:** If key plot drivers are split, the resulting nodes and edges might appear less connected or significant than they truly are in the narrative. The LLM might struggle to connect fragmented pieces into a coherent plot summary.\n\n**Recommendations for Chunk Size Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Increase Chunk Size for Narrative Cohesion:** Consider increasing the chunk size. A larger chunk size (e.g., 400-600 words, or even larger depending on testing) would increase the likelihood that a single, important narrative event, character interaction, or plot development is contained within a single chunk. This would allow the LLM to extract more complete and contextually rich graphs for each segment.\n    *   **Benefit:** This would directly address the \"Lack of Granularity in Plot Elements\" and \"Potential for Over-Specificity and Noise\" issues mentioned in the critique, by ensuring that more plot-critical information is grouped together.\n\n2.  **Experiment with Overlapping Chunks:** Even with a larger chunk size, consider implementing overlapping chunks. This can help to mitigate information loss at the boundaries of chunks, ensuring that context from adjacent segments is available during graph extraction.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Chunking (Advanced):** If possible, explore dynamic chunking strategies. Instead of a fixed size, chunks could be determined by semantic breaks in the text, such as chapter divisions, paragraph boundaries, or scene changes. This would naturally group related narrative elements.\n\nBy increasing the chunk size, the system has a better chance of capturing meaningful narrative arcs within each chunk, leading to a more coherent and useful graph for understanding the plot.", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the provided graph construction prompt, aimed at improving its effectiveness for narrative understanding:\n\n**Critique of the Graph Construction Prompt:**\n\nThe current prompt is a good starting point for extracting entities and relationships but lacks the specificity needed to build a graph that effectively supports narrative analysis, such as answering \"What is the plot of the story?\".\n\n1.  **Insufficient Focus on Narrative Structure:** The prompt asks for entities and relationships but doesn't explicitly guide the LLM to prioritize *narrative progression*. Key plot elements like sequence of events, cause-and-effect, character goals, motivations, and outcomes are not emphasized. The broad request for relationships, while capturing connections, doesn't guarantee the identification of those critical for storytelling.\n\n2.  **Ambiguity and Over-Generalization of Relationships:**\n    *   **Broad Relationship Types:** Many extracted relationship types are very general (e.g., \"associated with,\" \"interacts with,\" \"in\"). While factually correct, they don't convey the *nature* of the interaction or association crucial for plot comprehension. For instance, \"associated with\" could mean many things (friendship, rivalry, collaboration, proximity).\n    *   **Redundancy and Overlap:** The sample output shows numerous relationship types that appear to be synonymous or highly overlapping (e.g., \"in,\" \"located in,\" \"lives in/associated with,\" \"residence,\" \"located on,\" \"satellite of\"). This creates noise and makes it harder to identify the core narrative connections.\n    *   **Lack of Action/Event Focus:** The prompt doesn't specifically ask for relationships that represent actions, events, or transformations, which are the building blocks of a plot.\n\n3.  **Lack of Granularity in Entity Properties:** While the prompt asks for properties, it doesn't guide the LLM to extract properties that are narratively significant. For example, character traits, motivations, or the state/condition of objects/locations at specific points in the narrative are often crucial for understanding the plot.\n\n4.  **Absence of Temporal or Causal Information:** Plots unfold over time and involve causality. The current prompt does not prompt the LLM to extract or represent temporal ordering of events or explicit causal links between actions and consequences.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Emphasize Narrative Actions and Events:** Explicitly instruct the LLM to identify and represent *actions* performed by entities and *events* that occur. Prompt for relationships that describe \"who did what to whom,\" \"what happened as a result,\" and \"what are the main goals/conflicts.\"\n\n2.  **Define More Specific Relationship Types:** Guide the LLM to use or create more descriptive relationship types. For example, instead of just \"interacts with,\" prompt for \"helps,\" \"hinders,\" \"fights,\" \"communicates,\" \"travels to,\" \"uses,\" \"achieves,\" \"fails,\" etc. Consider a hierarchy where general types can be specialized.\n\n3.  **Incorporate Temporal and Causal Markers:** If possible, encourage the extraction of information that indicates sequence or causality. This could be through specific relationship types (e.g., \"leads to,\" \"causes,\" \"precedes\") or by asking for explicit descriptions of how events are linked.\n\n4.  **Focus on Key Narrative Elements:** Instruct the LLM to identify entities and relationships that are central to the main storyline, protagonist's journey, conflicts, and resolutions. This might involve prioritizing relationships involving main characters or significant plot points.\n\n5.  **Refine Property Extraction:** Guide the LLM to extract properties that reveal character motivations, traits, or the changing state of narrative elements. For example, \"Noork's memory erased\" is a critical state change.", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The provided retrieval plans show a significant disconnect between the agent's strategy and the actual graph exploration capabilities. The core problem lies in the agent's inability to move beyond superficial node identification and delve into the relational structure required to answer a query about the \"plot.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the issues and recommendations:\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Superficial Entity Extraction without Relation:** The initial plans focus heavily on identifying entities (e.g., \"Person\" nodes). While important, simply listing characters or locations does not constitute understanding a plot. The plans consistently fail to incorporate steps that explore the *relationships* between these entities. The graph, as described, is rich with relationship types that are crucial for narrative understanding (e.g., \"interacts with,\" \"travels to,\" \"attacked,\" \"killed\"), yet these are largely ignored.\n\n2.  **Ineffective Search Strategy for \"Plot\":** The repeated use of `search_nodes_by_keyword('plot')` is a reactive and likely ineffective strategy. A plot is not typically a single node labeled \"plot.\" Instead, it's an emergent property of character actions, events, and their connections. The agent should be *constructing* an understanding of the plot through relational exploration, not searching for a literal keyword.\n\n3.  **Lack of Depth in Exploration:** The plans do not demonstrate a strategic approach to traversing the graph to piece together a narrative. For instance, once \"Person\" nodes are identified, the logical next step would be to `get_neighbors` for key characters to understand their immediate connections and actions. The plans lack this sequential, deductive reasoning.\n\n4.  **Underutilization of Graph Properties:** The graph description highlights various entity and relationship types. The retrieval plans do not show any attempt to leverage these specific types to infer plot points. For example, searching for `travels to` relationships could reveal journey arcs, while `attacked` or `killed` relationships signal conflict and turning points.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relational Exploration:** The prompt needs to guide the agent to actively explore relationships between identified entities. Encourage using `get_neighbors` on key entities and then examining the *types* of relationships to infer plot elements.\n2.  **Develop Narrative-Driven Strategies:** Instead of searching for \"plot,\" the agent should be prompted to identify key actors, their motivations (if discernible from relationship types like \"desire,\" \"aims to save\"), and the sequence of their interactions or significant events.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement of Understanding:** Encourage the agent to use information from previous steps. If a character is identified, the next step should be to explore their connections, not just list more entities.\n4.  **Leverage Specific Relationship Types:** Prompt the agent to consider relationship types that are indicative of plot progression (e.g., actions, conflicts, travel, motivations). The prompt should emphasize using these to build a coherent story.\n5.  **Avoid Literal Keyword Searches for Abstract Concepts:** Train the agent to infer concepts like \"plot\" from structural graph information rather than seeking a direct keyword match.", "answer_generation_critique": "The current prompt for the answer generation LLM is too generic and lacks the necessary guidance to produce helpful and user-centric responses when information is insufficient.\n\n**Critique of the Current Prompt:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Persona/Role Definition:** The prompt doesn't assign a specific role or persona to the LLM. Phrases like \"You will be given...\" and \"Your goal is to use...\" are functional but don't encourage a conversational or helpful assistant-like demeanor. This contributes to the bluntness of the \"I am sorry, but I cannot provide...\" response.\n2.  **No Guidance on Handling Insufficient Information:** The prompt is designed for scenarios where information *is* present and sufficient. It offers no instructions on how the LLM should behave when the retrieved context *doesn't* directly answer the query. This leaves the LLM to its default behavior, which in this case, is to state the limitation directly.\n3.  **Absence of Instructions for Alternative Actions:** Crucially, the prompt doesn't instruct the LLM to offer alternative actions, ask clarifying questions, or suggest ways the user might rephrase their query or request different types of information. This is the core weakness highlighted by the feedback, preventing the system from being helpful.\n4.  **No Emphasis on User Experience:** The prompt's focus is solely on answering the query *using the provided information*. It doesn't prioritize the user's overall experience, which includes being guided towards a solution even when the initial attempt fails.\n5.  **Implicit Assumption of Direct Answerability:** The prompt implicitly assumes that the provided \"information\" will directly map to an answer. It doesn't account for situations where the information is related but not directly answering, or where it's of a different format (like graph data vs. narrative text).\n\n**Suggestions for Prompt Improvement:**\n\nTo address these issues and align with the feedback, the prompt should be significantly enhanced to:\n\n1.  **Define a Helpful Assistant Persona:** Instruct the LLM to act as a helpful and understanding assistant.\n2.  **Provide Explicit Instructions for Handling Insufficient Information:**\n    *   **Acknowledge Limitation Clearly but Politely:** Similar to the current response, but framed within the assistant persona.\n    *   **Explain *Why* (in user-friendly terms):** Guide the LLM to explain that the retrieved information (e.g., graph data) doesn't contain narrative plot details, using analogies if possible.\n    *   **Offer Concrete Next Steps/Alternatives:** This is the most critical addition. The prompt should instruct the LLM to suggest:\n        *   Searching for a plot summary using different methods.\n        *   Providing information about characters/relationships if that's of interest.\n        *   Asking the user if they'd like to refine their search.\n3.  **Emphasize User-Centricity:** Explicitly state that the goal is not just to answer, but to assist the user in achieving their objective, even if it requires alternative approaches.\n4.  **Guide Explanation of Retrieved Context:** If the retrieved context is a graph, the prompt should prompt the LLM to explain this simply before stating its limitations regarding narrative.\n\nBy incorporating these points, the prompt can be transformed from a simple data-mapping instruction to one that fosters a more interactive, helpful, and user-friendly RAG system.", "graph_builder_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text.

Therefore, I cannot provide a plot summary for any story,\" indicates a fundamental misunderstanding or a lack of relevant information.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why the response is problematic and how it can be improved:\n\n**Problems with the Current Response:**\n\n1.  **Misinterpretation of \"The Story\":** The system assumes \"the story\" refers to a story *within* its knowledge graph or retrieved documents. When it finds no such story data, it concludes there's nothing to summarize. It doesn't consider that the user might be referring to a story *outside* of the RAG system's immediate context, or that the system itself might be the \"story\" in a metaphorical sense (e.g., the story of how the system operates).\n2.  **Over-reliance on a Specific Data Structure (\"Graph\"):** The mention of an \"empty graph\" suggests the system's retrieval mechanism or internal representation is heavily tied to graph data. If the user's query isn't directly mappable to this structure, the system fails completely. This isn't user-friendly.\n3.  **Lack of Clarification or Guidance:** Instead of just stating it can't help, the response could guide the user on how to get help. The suggestion \"If you have information about a specific story or a knowledge graph that contains details about plots, please provide it\" is a good start, but it's still very technical (\"knowledge graph\").\n4.  **Abrupt and Unhelpful:** While polite, the response doesn't try to bridge the gap or offer alternative interpretations.\n\n**How to Improve the Response:**\n\nThe core issue is the system's inability to understand the user's intent when its direct data source is empty. The improvement should focus on:\n*   **Clarifying the ambiguity:** Ask the user for more context.\n*   **Acknowledging limitations gracefully:** Explain *why* it can't answer, but do so in simpler terms.\n*   **Providing actionable next steps:** Guide the user on how to rephrase their query or provide the necessary information.\n\nHere are several improved response options, ranging from simple to more sophisticated:\n\n**Improvement Option 1 (More Direct Clarification):**\n\n> \"I can't seem to find any information about a specific story in my current data. Could you please tell me which story you're interested in? If you can provide the title or a brief description, I'll try my best to find its plot for you.\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** Directly asks for clarification about *which* story. Avoids technical jargon like \"graph.\"\n\n**Improvement Option 2 (Acknowledging Potential Lack of Data and Guiding):**\n\n> \"I'm sorry, but I don't have any specific story details or plot information available right now. To help me understand what you're looking for, could you please:\n>\n> 1.  **Specify the story:** What is the title of the story you're interested in?\n> 2.  **Provide context:** Are you referring to a story discussed earlier, or a specific book, movie, or event?\n>\n> Once I have more information, I'll do my best to find the plot summary for you.\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** More structured, offers clear options for the user, and explains *why* it needs more info.\n\n**Improvement Option 3 (Slightly More Empathetic and Flexible):**\n\n> \"It seems I'm missing the information needed to tell you the plot of 'the story.' My current knowledge doesn't contain details about any particular narrative.\n>\n> To help me assist you, could you please provide more context? For example:\n>\n> *   What is the name of the story?\n> *   Where might I find information about it (e.g., a book title, a movie, a previous conversation topic)?\n>\n> I'm ready to help if you can give me a bit more to go on!\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** Uses softer language (\"missing the information,\" \"narrative\"). Offers flexible examples of what \"context\" could mean.\n\n**Improvement Option 4 (If the RAG system *can* process external text):**\n\n> \"I don't have a specific story pre-loaded or indexed that I can summarize. However, if you can provide me with the text of the story, or tell me its title and where it comes from (like a book, movie, or website), I can try to process that information and tell you the plot.\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** Clearly states its limitations but also offers a path forward if the user can supply the data directly.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Improvement:**\n\n*   **User-Centric Language:** Avoid internal technical terms like \"graph,\" \"nodes,\" or \"connections\" unless absolutely necessary and explained.\n*   **Clarification is Key:** When ambiguity exists (like \"the story\"), ask clarifying questions.\n*   **Actionable Suggestions:** Guide the user on *how* they can get the answer they need.\n*   **Flexibility:** The system should be able to handle queries that don't perfectly map to its internal structure. It should try to infer user intent or ask for more data.\n\nThe original response failed because it treated the query as a direct data lookup and, upon finding no data, gave up. An improved response would recognize the potential for misunderstanding or missing context and actively try to resolve it.", "repetition": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:18:04.915361"}, "rouge_score": 0.041121495327102804, "backward_pass_results": {}, "pipeline_success": true}], "rouge_progression": [0.05353728489483747, 0.041121495327102804], "final_rouge": 0.041121495327102804, "rouge_improvement": -0.012415789567734668}}}

When they speak, they learn that Noork has been living with her brother, Gurn.  With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.  He fights the priest, kills him, and frees Sarna.  They go back to the field, get Rold, and the three of them flee into the jungle.  They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle."], "document_text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\nRaiders of the Second Moon\nBy GENE ELLERMAN\nA strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny worldâ€”to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBeyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrichâ€”whose memory was\ngone completelyâ€”again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood womanâ€”and ugly, my son.\"\n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metalâ€”gold, silver and brassâ€”vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshippedâ€”mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyesâ€”-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchangedâ€”thickenedâ€”as he saw the features of Noork.\n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Raiders of the Second Moon, by Gene Ellerman\n\n", "document_length": 33709, "total_iterations": 2, "metadata": {"batch_id": 0, "dataset": "squality", "setting": "test"}}
