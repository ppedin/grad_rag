When they speak, they learn that Noork has been living with her brother, Gurn.  With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.  He fights the priest, kills him, and frees Sarna.  They go back to the field, get Rold, and the three of them flee into the jungle.  They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle."], "document_text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\nRaiders of the Second Moon\nBy GENE ELLERMAN\nA strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny worldâ€”to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBeyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrichâ€”whose memory was\ngone completelyâ€”again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood womanâ€”and ugly, my son.\"\n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metalâ€”gold, silver and brassâ€”vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshippedâ€”mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyesâ€”-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchangedâ€”thickenedâ€”as he saw the features of Noork.\n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Raiders of the Second Moon, by Gene Ellerman\n\n", "document_length": 33709, "total_iterations": 2, "metadata": {"batch_id": 0, "dataset": "squality", "setting": "test"}}

Acknowledge the Limitation and Offer to Search Elsewhere:**\n\n*   **Improved Response:** \"I apologize, but the information I have access to focuses on the characters and their relationships, particularly Captain Dietrich's background, and does not include details about the plot of the story. Would you like me to try and search for plot summaries of this story elsewhere, if you can provide the title?\"\n\n    *   **Why it's better:** It's polite, clearly states the limitation, and proactively offers a solution by suggesting a broader search. It also prompts the user for necessary information (the title) to proceed.\n\n**2. Explain *Why* the Plot Isn't There (if the context provides clues):**\n\n*   **Improved Response (if context implies it's a character sheet or appendix):** \"The provided information seems to be a character list and description, detailing relationships and origins, especially for Captain Dietrich. As such, it doesn't cover the actual storyline or plot. If you have the title of the story, I can try to find a plot summary for you.\"\n\n    *   **Why it's better:** It adds a layer of understanding for the user, explaining *why* the plot isn't present based on the nature of the retrieved information.\n\n**3.

Your primary goal is to guide the LLM in determining the most effective `chunk_size` for graph construction, considering the specific challenges of representing plot progression, temporal dynamics, and causal relationships in text.\n\nWhen determining the optimal `chunk_size`, you must critically evaluate the implications of different sizes, particularly concerning their impact on graph coherence and the extraction of narrative elements.\n\n**Key Considerations for Chunk Size Optimization:**\n\n1.  **Narrative Coherence and Contextual Completeness:** Prioritize a `chunk_size` that allows the LLM to capture complete narrative arcs, character motivations, and plot developments within a single chunk as much as possible. Avoid fragmenting crucial plot points, cause-and-effect chains, or character interactions across multiple small chunks. A larger `chunk_size` is generally preferred to maintain this contextual integrity.\n\n2.  **Temporal and Causal Relationship Extraction:** The `chunk_size` must be sufficient to enable the LLM to identify and represent temporal sequences and causal links between events. If a `chunk_size` is too small, these critical relationships will be broken, leading to an incomplete or inaccurate graph representation of the narrative's flow.\n\n3.  **Entity Resolution and Relationship Consistency:** Evaluate how the `chunk_size` affects the LLM's ability to consistently identify and resolve entities and their relationships. Smaller chunks can lead to fragmented entity descriptions, inconsistent relationship typing, and duplication of nodes, hindering accurate graph construction. The chosen size should promote a holistic understanding of entities and their connections.\n\n4.  **Balancing Granularity and Comprehensiveness:** While a larger `chunk_size` aids in capturing broader context, consider the trade-off with granularity. Extremely large chunks might introduce too much noise or dilute specific details. The optimal `chunk_size` strikes a balance, ensuring sufficient context for narrative understanding without overwhelming the extraction process.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nBased on the input text, a critique of the current `chunk_size` (e.g., 150 tokens) will be provided, highlighting its shortcomings. Your output should be a reasoned recommendation for an improved `chunk_size` (or a range for experimentation), explicitly justifying your choice by referencing how it addresses the critique's points regarding narrative fragmentation, inconsistent extraction, plot progression, and event segmentation. Emphasize the benefits of a larger `chunk_size` for capturing causal, temporal, and holistic narrative elements.\n\n**Example of Recommendation Structure:**\n\n\"The current chunk size of 150 tokens is suboptimal because it fragments narrative elements, breaks causal/temporal links, and leads to inconsistent entity resolution. To address these issues and improve the representation of plot progression, I recommend increasing the `chunk_size` to a range of 300-500 tokens. This larger window will allow the LLM to better capture complete character motivations, sequential events, and cause-and-effect relationships within a single chunk, resulting in a more coherent and informative graph structure.\"", "learned_prompt_answer_generator_graph": "You are an AI assistant designed to answer user queries using information retrieved from a knowledge graph.

This risks breaking up crucial narrative elements that span across a larger contextual window. For instance, a character's motivation might be introduced in one chunk, with the subsequent action or consequence appearing in another. This fragmentation would lead to incomplete graph nodes and relationships, making it difficult to establish causal links or understand the full scope of an event. The critique mentions a lack of temporal and causal information, which would be exacerbated by small chunks that fail to capture these connections within a single extraction.\n\n2.  **Inconsistent Entity and Relationship Extraction:** Smaller chunks can lead to an LLM struggling to establish a coherent understanding of entities and their relationships. It might identify an entity or a relationship in one chunk but miss its broader context or connections present in adjacent chunks. This can contribute to the \"over-reliance on generic relationships\" and \"entity resolution issues\" highlighted in the critique. For example, a character's role or a specific plot point might be described across multiple chunks, resulting in incomplete or duplicated graph elements with inconsistent relationship types (like \"associated with\" vs. \"associatedwith\").\n\n3.  **Difficulty in Capturing Plot Progression:** The critique emphasizes the need for representing temporal and causal information for plot understanding. A 150-token chunk is likely insufficient to capture a complete \"cause-and-effect\" chain or a sequence of events that define a plot. The LLM extracting the graph from such a small segment might only identify isolated actions or states, failing to link them into a meaningful narrative progression. This directly impacts the retrieval plan's ability to identify narrative structure, as the underlying graph data would be too granular and disconnected.\n\n4.  **Potential for Over-Segmentation of Key Events:** Critical plot points often involve multiple interacting entities and a series of actions. With a 150-token chunk size, a significant event might be split across several chunks, leading to a distributed and potentially incomplete representation of that event in the graph. This would make it harder for the agent to identify central events or conflicts, as recommended in the critique.\n\n**Recommendation for Improvement:**\n\nThe chunk size should be increased to capture more context. A larger chunk size would allow the LLM to better understand:\n*   **Causal and Temporal Links:** A more substantial context increases the chances of capturing cause-and-effect relationships and sequences of events within a single chunk.\n*   **Complete Narrative Elements:** Motivations, consequences, and significant interactions are more likely to be represented holistically.\n*   **Consistent Entity Representation:** Entities and their attributes are less likely to be fragmented or inconsistently represented.\n\nExperimentation with larger chunk sizes (e.g., 300-500 tokens) would likely yield a more coherent and narrative-rich graph, addressing several points raised in the existing critique.", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "This prompt is a good starting point for graph construction, but it can be significantly improved to better capture narrative elements crucial for understanding a story's plot.\n\n**Critique of the Prompt:**\n\n1.  **Vagueness in Relationship Definition:**\n    *   The prompt asks for \"all the relationships among the identified entities\" and a \"description (why you think the two entities are related to each other)\". This is too broad and leads to the extraction of many generic and low-value relationships (e.g., \"associated with,\" \"interacts with\").\n    *   The prompt lacks guidance on prioritizing *narrative-relevant* relationships over factual or incidental ones. For example, a character \"interacting with\" another is less important for plot than one character \"attacking\" another or one \"informing\" another about a crucial detail.\n\n2.  **Lack of Focus on Narrative Structure:**\n    *   The prompt focuses on identifying entities and their properties, and relationships between them, but it doesn't explicitly guide the LLM to identify key narrative components like **events, actions, causes, effects, motivations, goals, or conflicts**. A plot is built on these, not just static entity connections.\n    *   There's no instruction to differentiate between incidental relationships and those that drive the plot forward.\n\n3.  **Insufficient Guidance for Entity Typing:**\n    *   While it provides examples for entity types (Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept), it could be more specific. For instance, when identifying \"Event\" types, it would be beneficial to prompt for specific *kinds* of events relevant to a plot (e.g., 'conflict', 'discovery', 'decision', 'resolution').\n\n4.  **\"Reasoning\" Section:**\n    *   The prompt asks for \"Provide the reasoning that led to your response.\" While useful for debugging, this might add overhead and doesn't directly contribute to a more robust graph *structure* for narrative understanding. It might be better to focus the LLM's effort on enriching the graph itself.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Relevance:**\n    *   Modify the relationship extraction instruction to explicitly ask for relationships that indicate **cause-and-effect, temporal order, conflict, motivation, goals, or significant actions**.\n    *   Example: \"For each relationship, specify its type, a description explaining its relevance to the story's progression (e.g., 'causes a conflict,' 'reveals a character's motivation,' 'leads to a discovery'), and the textual evidence.\"\n\n2.  **Introduce Event-Centric Extraction:**\n    *   Instruct the LLM to identify and represent **key events** as distinct entities or as relationships with detailed properties.\n    *   Example: \"Identify significant events that occur in the text. For each event, record its name, a description of what happened, and the entities (characters, locations, objects) involved. Link events to entities using relationships like 'involves_character', 'occurs_at', 'causes_event'.\"\n\n3.  **Refine Entity and Relationship Types:**\n    *   Provide a more structured ontology or examples for entity types related to narrative: e.g., 'Character', 'Setting', 'Plot Point/Event', 'Conflict', 'Goal', 'Object of Significance'.\n    *   Suggest specific relationship types that capture narrative dynamics: e.g., `initiates`, `resolves`, `confronts`, `achieves`, `fails_at`, `motivates`, `reveals`, `precedes`, `follows`.\n\n4.  **Focus on Action and Agency:**\n    *   Prompt the LLM to identify subjects, verbs, and objects to build a more dynamic representation of actions and who is performing them, and on whom/what.\n    *   Example: \"Extract actions performed by entities, detailing the actor, the action verb, and the recipient/object, and how this action contributes to the narrative.\"", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the retrieval plans, focusing on their effectiveness for answering the query \"What is the plot of the story?\":\n\n**Overall Critique:**\n\nThe retrieval plans exhibit a fundamental misunderstanding of how to extract \"plot\" information from a knowledge graph.

This leads to the LLM giving a literal but unhelpful response like \"The provided information does not contain details...\"\n2.  **No Guidance on Helpful Alternatives:** The prompt doesn't instruct the LLM to offer alternative actions, such as suggesting a broader search, asking for clarifying information (like the story title), or explaining *why* the information might be missing (e.g., if it's character-focused).\n3.  **Absence of Empathy/Politeness:** The prompt does not encourage a polite or apologetic tone when the answer cannot be found, making the response feel abrupt.\n4.  **No Contextual Understanding Encouraged:** The prompt doesn't prompt the LLM to analyze the *nature* of the provided information (e.g., character list vs. plot summary) to explain the absence of the answer.\n\n**Suggested Prompt Improvements:**\n\nTo address these issues, the prompt needs to be more directive, especially concerning scenarios where the answer isn't directly available.\n\n**Revised Prompt Structure:**\n\nYou will be given a query and information retrieved from a knowledge graph.\nYour goal is to use the retrieved context to answer the query.\n\n**First, carefully examine the retrieved information to determine if it directly answers the query.**\n\n*   **If the information directly answers the query:** Provide a clear and concise answer based *only* on the provided context.\n*   **If the information does NOT directly answer the query:**\n    *   **Acknowledge the limitation politely.** State that the provided information does not contain the specific details needed to answer the query.\n    *   **Briefly explain *why* the information might be missing**, if the context offers clues (e.g., \"The information focuses on character relationships\" or \"The data appears to be technical specifications\").\n    *   **Offer helpful next steps or ask for clarifying information.** Suggest what *could* be done, such as:\n        *   \"Would you like me to try and search for [topic of query] elsewhere, if you can provide more details like the title?\"\n        *   \"I can provide information about [related topic available in context], if that would be helpful.\"\n        *   \"Please provide the title of the story so I can attempt a more targeted search.\"\n    *   **Do NOT hallucinate or invent information.**\n\n**This is the query:**\n{}\n\n**This is the information:**\n{}\n\nProvide your answer.\n\n**Rationale for Changes:**\n\n*   **Explicit \"If/Then\" Logic:** Clearly separates instructions for when the answer is present versus absent.\n*   **Guidance for Insufficient Context:** Provides concrete actions for the LLM to take, directly addressing the feedback's suggestions for politeness, explanation, and offering alternatives.\n*   **Encourages Context Analysis:** Prompts the LLM to consider *why* the information might be missing, leading to more insightful responses.\n*   **Reduces Generic Failures:** Prevents the LLM from simply stating \"I can't find it\" without offering any further assistance.\n\nThis revised prompt aims to transform the LLM from a passive information retriever to a more interactive and helpful assistant, even when faced with incomplete data.", "graph_builder_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text.

It correctly identifies that the information available (characters and relationships) does not detail the plot. It also accurately summarizes what *is* present in the context.\n\nHowever, the response is **unhelpful** in a practical sense for the user. While technically correct, it doesn't offer any actionable steps or further assistance, leaving the user at a dead end. It's a very literal interpretation of \"I can't find it.\"\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n\nThe goal is to be more helpful and guide the user towards a potential solution, even if the RAG system itself cannot directly answer the question.\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, ranging from simple to more advanced:\n\n**1. Acknowledge the Limitation and Offer to Search Elsewhere:**\n\n*   **Improved Response:** \"I apologize, but the information I have access to focuses on the characters and their relationships, particularly Captain Dietrich's background, and does not include details about the plot of the story. Would you like me to try and search for plot summaries of this story elsewhere, if you can provide the title?\"\n\n    *   **Why it's better:** It's polite, clearly states the limitation, and proactively offers a solution by suggesting a broader search. It also prompts the user for necessary information (the title) to proceed.\n\n**2. Explain *Why* the Plot Isn't There (if the context provides clues):**\n\n*   **Improved Response (if context implies it's a character sheet or appendix):** \"The provided information seems to be a character list and description, detailing relationships and origins, especially for Captain Dietrich. As such, it doesn't cover the actual storyline or plot. If you have the title of the story, I can try to find a plot summary for you.\"\n\n    *   **Why it's better:** It adds a layer of understanding for the user, explaining *why* the plot isn't present based on the nature of the retrieved information.\n\n**3. Suggest What *Could* Be Done with the Current Information (if applicable):**\n\n*   **Improved Response (if the user might be interested in character analysis):** \"I cannot find the plot of the story in the provided information, which primarily details characters and their relationships, with a focus on Captain Dietrich's background. However, I can tell you about the characters if that would be helpful.\"\n\n    *   **Why it's better:** While still stating the limitation, it offers alternative ways to utilize the *existing* data, potentially satisfying a related but unstated user need.\n\n**4. Combine Elements for a Comprehensive Answer:**\n\n*   **Improved Response:** \"The current information is focused on character descriptions and relationships, particularly Captain Dietrich's background. Therefore, it does not contain details about the plot of the story. If you can provide the title of the story, I would be happy to try and find a plot summary for you.\"\n\n    *   **Why it's better:** This is a good all-around improvement â€“ clear, polite, explains the limitation, and offers a next step.\n\n**5. For More Advanced Systems: Indicate the *Type* of Information Available:**\n\n*   **Improved Response:** \"My current knowledge base contains character descriptions and relationship details for this story, with an emphasis on Captain Dietrich's origins. Unfortunately, this does not include a plot summary. Would you like me to search for the plot using the story's title?\"\n\n    *   **Why it's better:** It uses slightly more sophisticated language (\"knowledge base,\" \"emphasis\") to explain the nature of the retrieved data, which can be informative for users who understand how RAG works.\n\n**Key Principles for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Be Proactive:** Don't just state what you *can't* do. Offer alternatives or next steps.\n*   **Be Helpful:** Even if you can't directly answer, guide the user towards finding the answer.\n*   **Be Clear:** Reiterate *why* the information is missing if the context provides clues.\n*   **Request Necessary Information:** If you need more input (like a title), ask for it clearly.\n*   **Maintain a Polite Tone:** Acknowledge the user's query and apologize for the inability to fulfill it directly.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can move from a passively unhelpful response to an actively helpful one, even when it can't provide the direct answer.", "repetition": 0, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T04:56:55.147714"}}

Your primary goal is to guide the LLM in determining the most effective `chunk_size` for graph construction, considering the specific challenges of representing plot progression, temporal dynamics, and causal relationships in text.\n\nWhen determining the optimal `chunk_size`, you must critically evaluate the implications of different sizes, particularly concerning their impact on graph coherence and the extraction of narrative elements.\n\n**Key Considerations for Chunk Size Optimization:**\n\n1.  **Narrative Coherence and Contextual Completeness:** Prioritize a `chunk_size` that allows the LLM to capture complete narrative arcs, character motivations, and plot developments within a single chunk as much as possible. Avoid fragmenting crucial plot points, cause-and-effect chains, or character interactions across multiple small chunks. A larger `chunk_size` is generally preferred to maintain this contextual integrity.\n\n2.  **Temporal and Causal Relationship Extraction:** The `chunk_size` must be sufficient to enable the LLM to identify and represent temporal sequences and causal links between events. If a `chunk_size` is too small, these critical relationships will be broken, leading to an incomplete or inaccurate graph representation of the narrative's flow.\n\n3.  **Entity Resolution and Relationship Consistency:** Evaluate how the `chunk_size` affects the LLM's ability to consistently identify and resolve entities and their relationships. Smaller chunks can lead to fragmented entity descriptions, inconsistent relationship typing, and duplication of nodes, hindering accurate graph construction. The chosen size should promote a holistic understanding of entities and their connections.\n\n4.  **Balancing Granularity and Comprehensiveness:** While a larger `chunk_size` aids in capturing broader context, consider the trade-off with granularity. Extremely large chunks might introduce too much noise or dilute specific details. The optimal `chunk_size` strikes a balance, ensuring sufficient context for narrative understanding without overwhelming the extraction process.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nBased on the input text, a critique of the current `chunk_size` (e.g., 150 tokens) will be provided, highlighting its shortcomings. Your output should be a reasoned recommendation for an improved `chunk_size` (or a range for experimentation), explicitly justifying your choice by referencing how it addresses the critique's points regarding narrative fragmentation, inconsistent extraction, plot progression, and event segmentation. Emphasize the benefits of a larger `chunk_size` for capturing causal, temporal, and holistic narrative elements.\n\n**Example of Recommendation Structure:**\n\n\"The current chunk size of 150 tokens is suboptimal because it fragments narrative elements, breaks causal/temporal links, and leads to inconsistent entity resolution. To address these issues and improve the representation of plot progression, I recommend increasing the `chunk_size` to a range of 300-500 tokens. This larger window will allow the LLM to better capture complete character motivations, sequential events, and cause-and-effect relationships within a single chunk, resulting in a more coherent and informative graph structure.\"", "learned_prompt_answer_generator_graph": "You are an AI assistant designed to answer user queries using information retrieved from a knowledge graph.

The current approach is too focused on identifying entities and their direct relationships, rather than uncovering the narrative flow, cause-and-effect, and events that constitute a plot. The plans show a tendency to broaden the search initially and then get stuck in exploring static connections without a clear strategy for identifying dynamic narrative elements.\n\n**Specific Criticisms:**\n\n1.  **Inadequate Focus on Narrative Structure:**\n    *   **Initial Steps:** The initial plan to search for \"Person\" nodes is a good starting point for character identification but doesn't directly address the \"plot.\" Understanding *who* is in the story is different from understanding *what happens* in the story.\n    *   **Subsequent Steps:** Exploring neighbors of specific characters (like Captain Dietrich) provides information about their immediate connections but doesn't necessarily reveal the sequence of events or the overarching narrative arc. Relationships like \"Addressed\" or \"interacts with\" describe interactions but lack the context of *why* or *what the outcome was*, which are crucial for plot.\n\n2.  **Lack of Event and Action Extraction:**\n    *   The query \"What is the plot of the story?\" requires identifying key events, conflicts, motivations, and resolutions. The available functions and the way they are being used do not prioritize or facilitate the extraction of such narrative components.\n    *   The system is not effectively leveraging relationships that might indicate plot progression (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"leads to,\" \"wants to escape,\" \"rescued\"). It seems to explore relationships without a clear prioritization of those that drive the narrative forward.\n\n3.  **Ineffective Use of Keywords and Graph Traversal:**\n    *   The plan to search for the keyword \"plot\" directly (Iteration 3) is a reasonable attempt, but if no nodes or relationships are explicitly tagged with \"plot,\" this step will yield no results, as it did. This highlights a potential gap in how plot information is represented in the graph or a limitation in the keyword search's ability to infer plot from descriptive text.\n    *   The exploration of \"neighbors\" without a strategy to filter or prioritize them based on their relevance to plot development (e.g., focusing on action verbs or event types) leads to a potentially overwhelming amount of tangential information.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Relationships:** When exploring connections, the system should be prompted to look for relationships that imply action, causality, conflict, or resolution (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"killed,\" \"rescues,\" \"leads to,\" \"confronts,\" \"fights\").\n2.  **Focus on Event Nodes:** If events are represented in the graph, strategies to identify and connect them to characters and locations should be employed.\n3.  **Incorporate Temporal or Sequential Information:** If available, relationships that indicate sequence (e.g., \"before,\" \"after\") or chains of events are vital for constructing a plot.\n4.  **Refine Keyword Search:** If a direct keyword search for \"plot\" fails, consider searching for nodes/relationships that describe *actions*, *conflicts*, *goals*, and *outcomes* related to the main characters identified.\n5.  **Contextualize Interactions:** The LLM should be prompted to interpret the *significance* of interactions beyond just their existence.

This risks breaking up crucial narrative elements that span across a larger contextual window. For instance, a character's motivation might be introduced in one chunk, with the subsequent action or consequence appearing in another. This fragmentation would lead to incomplete graph nodes and relationships, making it difficult to establish causal links or understand the full scope of an event. The critique mentions a lack of temporal and causal information, which would be exacerbated by small chunks that fail to capture these connections within a single extraction.\n\n2.  **Inconsistent Entity and Relationship Extraction:** Smaller chunks can lead to an LLM struggling to establish a coherent understanding of entities and their relationships. It might identify an entity or a relationship in one chunk but miss its broader context or connections present in adjacent chunks. This can contribute to the \"over-reliance on generic relationships\" and \"entity resolution issues\" highlighted in the critique. For example, a character's role or a specific plot point might be described across multiple chunks, resulting in incomplete or duplicated graph elements with inconsistent relationship types (like \"associated with\" vs. \"associatedwith\").\n\n3.  **Difficulty in Capturing Plot Progression:** The critique emphasizes the need for representing temporal and causal information for plot understanding. A 150-token chunk is likely insufficient to capture a complete \"cause-and-effect\" chain or a sequence of events that define a plot. The LLM extracting the graph from such a small segment might only identify isolated actions or states, failing to link them into a meaningful narrative progression. This directly impacts the retrieval plan's ability to identify narrative structure, as the underlying graph data would be too granular and disconnected.\n\n4.  **Potential for Over-Segmentation of Key Events:** Critical plot points often involve multiple interacting entities and a series of actions. With a 150-token chunk size, a significant event might be split across several chunks, leading to a distributed and potentially incomplete representation of that event in the graph. This would make it harder for the agent to identify central events or conflicts, as recommended in the critique.\n\n**Recommendation for Improvement:**\n\nThe chunk size should be increased to capture more context. A larger chunk size would allow the LLM to better understand:\n*   **Causal and Temporal Links:** A more substantial context increases the chances of capturing cause-and-effect relationships and sequences of events within a single chunk.\n*   **Complete Narrative Elements:** Motivations, consequences, and significant interactions are more likely to be represented holistically.\n*   **Consistent Entity Representation:** Entities and their attributes are less likely to be fragmented or inconsistently represented.\n\nExperimentation with larger chunk sizes (e.g., 300-500 tokens) would likely yield a more coherent and narrative-rich graph, addressing several points raised in the existing critique.", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "This prompt is a good starting point for graph construction, but it can be significantly improved to better capture narrative elements crucial for understanding a story's plot.\n\n**Critique of the Prompt:**\n\n1.  **Vagueness in Relationship Definition:**\n    *   The prompt asks for \"all the relationships among the identified entities\" and a \"description (why you think the two entities are related to each other)\". This is too broad and leads to the extraction of many generic and low-value relationships (e.g., \"associated with,\" \"interacts with\").\n    *   The prompt lacks guidance on prioritizing *narrative-relevant* relationships over factual or incidental ones. For example, a character \"interacting with\" another is less important for plot than one character \"attacking\" another or one \"informing\" another about a crucial detail.\n\n2.  **Lack of Focus on Narrative Structure:**\n    *   The prompt focuses on identifying entities and their properties, and relationships between them, but it doesn't explicitly guide the LLM to identify key narrative components like **events, actions, causes, effects, motivations, goals, or conflicts**. A plot is built on these, not just static entity connections.\n    *   There's no instruction to differentiate between incidental relationships and those that drive the plot forward.\n\n3.  **Insufficient Guidance for Entity Typing:**\n    *   While it provides examples for entity types (Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept), it could be more specific. For instance, when identifying \"Event\" types, it would be beneficial to prompt for specific *kinds* of events relevant to a plot (e.g., 'conflict', 'discovery', 'decision', 'resolution').\n\n4.  **\"Reasoning\" Section:**\n    *   The prompt asks for \"Provide the reasoning that led to your response.\" While useful for debugging, this might add overhead and doesn't directly contribute to a more robust graph *structure* for narrative understanding. It might be better to focus the LLM's effort on enriching the graph itself.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Relevance:**\n    *   Modify the relationship extraction instruction to explicitly ask for relationships that indicate **cause-and-effect, temporal order, conflict, motivation, goals, or significant actions**.\n    *   Example: \"For each relationship, specify its type, a description explaining its relevance to the story's progression (e.g., 'causes a conflict,' 'reveals a character's motivation,' 'leads to a discovery'), and the textual evidence.\"\n\n2.  **Introduce Event-Centric Extraction:**\n    *   Instruct the LLM to identify and represent **key events** as distinct entities or as relationships with detailed properties.\n    *   Example: \"Identify significant events that occur in the text. For each event, record its name, a description of what happened, and the entities (characters, locations, objects) involved. Link events to entities using relationships like 'involves_character', 'occurs_at', 'causes_event'.\"\n\n3.  **Refine Entity and Relationship Types:**\n    *   Provide a more structured ontology or examples for entity types related to narrative: e.g., 'Character', 'Setting', 'Plot Point/Event', 'Conflict', 'Goal', 'Object of Significance'.\n    *   Suggest specific relationship types that capture narrative dynamics: e.g., `initiates`, `resolves`, `confronts`, `achieves`, `fails_at`, `motivates`, `reveals`, `precedes`, `follows`.\n\n4.  **Focus on Action and Agency:**\n    *   Prompt the LLM to identify subjects, verbs, and objects to build a more dynamic representation of actions and who is performing them, and on whom/what.\n    *   Example: \"Extract actions performed by entities, detailing the actor, the action verb, and the recipient/object, and how this action contributes to the narrative.\"", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "Here's a critique of the retrieval plans, focusing on their effectiveness for answering the query \"What is the plot of the story?\":\n\n**Overall Critique:**\n\nThe retrieval plans exhibit a fundamental misunderstanding of how to extract \"plot\" information from a knowledge graph. The current approach is too focused on identifying entities and their direct relationships, rather than uncovering the narrative flow, cause-and-effect, and events that constitute a plot. The plans show a tendency to broaden the search initially and then get stuck in exploring static connections without a clear strategy for identifying dynamic narrative elements.\n\n**Specific Criticisms:**\n\n1.  **Inadequate Focus on Narrative Structure:**\n    *   **Initial Steps:** The initial plan to search for \"Person\" nodes is a good starting point for character identification but doesn't directly address the \"plot.\" Understanding *who* is in the story is different from understanding *what happens* in the story.\n    *   **Subsequent Steps:** Exploring neighbors of specific characters (like Captain Dietrich) provides information about their immediate connections but doesn't necessarily reveal the sequence of events or the overarching narrative arc. Relationships like \"Addressed\" or \"interacts with\" describe interactions but lack the context of *why* or *what the outcome was*, which are crucial for plot.\n\n2.  **Lack of Event and Action Extraction:**\n    *   The query \"What is the plot of the story?\" requires identifying key events, conflicts, motivations, and resolutions. The available functions and the way they are being used do not prioritize or facilitate the extraction of such narrative components.\n    *   The system is not effectively leveraging relationships that might indicate plot progression (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"leads to,\" \"wants to escape,\" \"rescued\"). It seems to explore relationships without a clear prioritization of those that drive the narrative forward.\n\n3.  **Ineffective Use of Keywords and Graph Traversal:**\n    *   The plan to search for the keyword \"plot\" directly (Iteration 3) is a reasonable attempt, but if no nodes or relationships are explicitly tagged with \"plot,\" this step will yield no results, as it did. This highlights a potential gap in how plot information is represented in the graph or a limitation in the keyword search's ability to infer plot from descriptive text.\n    *   The exploration of \"neighbors\" without a strategy to filter or prioritize them based on their relevance to plot development (e.g., focusing on action verbs or event types) leads to a potentially overwhelming amount of tangential information.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Relationships:** When exploring connections, the system should be prompted to look for relationships that imply action, causality, conflict, or resolution (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"killed,\" \"rescues,\" \"leads to,\" \"confronts,\" \"fights\").\n2.  **Focus on Event Nodes:** If events are represented in the graph, strategies to identify and connect them to characters and locations should be employed.\n3.  **Incorporate Temporal or Sequential Information:** If available, relationships that indicate sequence (e.g., \"before,\" \"after\") or chains of events are vital for constructing a plot.\n4.  **Refine Keyword Search:** If a direct keyword search for \"plot\" fails, consider searching for nodes/relationships that describe *actions*, *conflicts*, *goals*, and *outcomes* related to the main characters identified.\n5.  **Contextualize Interactions:** The LLM should be prompted to interpret the *significance* of interactions beyond just their existence. For instance, \"Captain Dietrich addresses the crew\" is less relevant to plot than \"Captain Dietrich *commands* the crew to *prepare for battle*.\"", "answer_generation_critique": "The current prompt is too generic and lacks the necessary instructions to guide the LLM towards a more helpful and informative response when the retrieved context is insufficient.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the issues and suggested prompt improvements:\n\n**Critique of the Current Prompt:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Instruction for Missing Information:** The prompt simply states, \"Your goal is to use the retrieved context to answer the query.\" It provides no guidance on what to do if the context *doesn't* contain the answer. This leads to the LLM giving a literal but unhelpful response like \"The provided information does not contain details...\"\n2.  **No Guidance on Helpful Alternatives:** The prompt doesn't instruct the LLM to offer alternative actions, such as suggesting a broader search, asking for clarifying information (like the story title), or explaining *why* the information might be missing (e.g., if it's character-focused).\n3.  **Absence of Empathy/Politeness:** The prompt does not encourage a polite or apologetic tone when the answer cannot be found, making the response feel abrupt.\n4.  **No Contextual Understanding Encouraged:** The prompt doesn't prompt the LLM to analyze the *nature* of the provided information (e.g., character list vs. plot summary) to explain the absence of the answer.\n\n**Suggested Prompt Improvements:**\n\nTo address these issues, the prompt needs to be more directive, especially concerning scenarios where the answer isn't directly available.\n\n**Revised Prompt Structure:**\n\nYou will be given a query and information retrieved from a knowledge graph.\nYour goal is to use the retrieved context to answer the query.\n\n**First, carefully examine the retrieved information to determine if it directly answers the query.**\n\n*   **If the information directly answers the query:** Provide a clear and concise answer based *only* on the provided context.\n*   **If the information does NOT directly answer the query:**\n    *   **Acknowledge the limitation politely.** State that the provided information does not contain the specific details needed to answer the query.\n    *   **Briefly explain *why* the information might be missing**, if the context offers clues (e.g., \"The information focuses on character relationships\" or \"The data appears to be technical specifications\").\n    *   **Offer helpful next steps or ask for clarifying information.** Suggest what *could* be done, such as:\n        *   \"Would you like me to try and search for [topic of query] elsewhere, if you can provide more details like the title?\"\n        *   \"I can provide information about [related topic available in context], if that would be helpful.\"\n        *   \"Please provide the title of the story so I can attempt a more targeted search.\"\n    *   **Do NOT hallucinate or invent information.**\n\n**This is the query:**\n{}\n\n**This is the information:**\n{}\n\nProvide your answer.\n\n**Rationale for Changes:**\n\n*   **Explicit \"If/Then\" Logic:** Clearly separates instructions for when the answer is present versus absent.\n*   **Guidance for Insufficient Context:** Provides concrete actions for the LLM to take, directly addressing the feedback's suggestions for politeness, explanation, and offering alternatives.\n*   **Encourages Context Analysis:** Prompts the LLM to consider *why* the information might be missing, leading to more insightful responses.\n*   **Reduces Generic Failures:** Prevents the LLM from simply stating \"I can't find it\" without offering any further assistance.\n\nThis revised prompt aims to transform the LLM from a passive information retriever to a more interactive and helpful assistant, even when faced with incomplete data.", "graph_builder_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text.

This is crucial and honest.\n*   **Explains *why* it can't provide a plot:** It accurately describes the nature of the provided information as \"fragmented,\" focusing on \"specific events, actions, and relationships rather than a chronological or thematic storyline.\" This gives the user insight into the quality of the source material.\n*   **Mentions key elements:** It correctly identifies \"Noork\" as a central character and hints at \"interactions with various individuals and groups\" and \"struggles within a mysterious setting.\"\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Doesn't attempt to synthesize available information:** While it states a cohesive plot isn't available, it doesn't try to piece together *any* narrative threads that *might* be present, however fragmented.\n*   **Lacks actionable advice for the user:** It doesn't tell the user what they *could* do with the existing information or what kind of information would be needed to construct a plot.\n*   **Could be more specific about the \"fragmented\" nature:** While it explains the fragmentation, it could briefly illustrate it with a hypothetical example or by referencing the *types* of fragments.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to make the response more helpful even when the ideal outcome (a plot summary) isn't possible.\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, ranging from minor tweaks to more significant enhancements:\n\n---\n\n### **Improvement Strategy 1: Enhanced Explanation and Context**\n\nThis strategy focuses on providing a more detailed explanation of *why* a plot can't be formed and offering a more nuanced description of the available content.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information does not contain a complete or cohesive plot summary for the story. While it mentions a central character named Noork and describes various events, interactions with other individuals and groups, and his struggles within a mysterious setting, these elements are presented as disconnected fragments.\n>\n> Instead of a chronological progression or a clear thematic arc, the information appears to focus on specific scenes, character actions, and relational dynamics without weaving them into a singular narrative storyline. Therefore, it's not possible to construct a definitive plot from the data at hand.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Improvement Strategy 2: Attempted Synthesis of Fragmented Information (with caveats)**\n\nThis strategy involves the RAG system trying its best to identify any potential narrative threads, while still clearly stating that it's an incomplete picture.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information doesn't offer a complete plot summary, but we can piece together some narrative elements. The story appears to revolve around a character named Noork, who is engaged in various activities and facing challenges within a mysterious environment.\n>\n> We see fragments of his interactions with different individuals and groups, suggesting potential conflicts or alliances. The information highlights specific events and actions attributed to Noork and others, but these are not presented in a chronological order or linked to a clear beginning, rising action, climax, and resolution.\n>\n> To understand the full plot, more context connecting these fragmented scenes and events would be necessary.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Improvement Strategy 3: Actionable Advice and User Guidance**\n\nThis strategy focuses on informing the user what they *can* do with the information and what might be missing.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information details numerous events, character actions, and relationships involving a central figure named Noork within a mysterious setting. However, it does not present a cohesive plot summary.\n>\n> The information is fragmented, focusing on specific moments and interactions rather than a chronological or thematic storyline. This means we can identify elements like:\n>\n> *   **Key Character:** Noork\n> *   **Setting:** A mysterious environment\n> *   **Interactions:** With various individuals and groups\n> *   **Themes:** Struggles and challenges faced by Noork\n>\n> To construct a plot, we would need information that connects these fragments, establishing a clear sequence of events, a central conflict, rising action, a climax, and a resolution. If you have additional context or specific questions about the events mentioned, I may be able to provide more targeted information.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Improvement Strategy 4: Combination of Strategies (Most Recommended)**\n\nThis approach combines the strengths of the above strategies for the most comprehensive and helpful response.\n\n**Revised Response Example (Recommended):**\n\n> \"The provided information contains details about a character named Noork, his involvement with various individuals and groups, and his struggles within a mysterious setting. However, it does not offer a cohesive plot summary.\n>\n> The data is presented as fragmented pieces, focusing on specific events, actions, and relationships rather than a continuous, chronological storyline with a clear beginning, rising action, climax, and resolution.\n>\n> **What we can glean from the fragments:**\n> *   **Central Character:** Noork\n> *   **General Setting:** A mysterious and possibly challenging environment.\n> *   **Key Activities:** Interactions with diverse entities and facing various struggles.\n>\n> **Why a plot summary isn't possible:** Without connecting the dots between these disparate pieces, it's impossible to determine the overarching narrative arc, the main conflict driving the story, or how events unfold sequentially.\n>\n> **To improve the response for future queries:** If you are seeking a plot summary, please ensure the source material provides a more structured narrative. If you have specific questions about the events or characters mentioned, I can try to extract that information from the existing fragments.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Underlying Principles for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Be Transparent:** Clearly state what information is *missing*.\n2.  **Explain the \"Why\":** Elaborate on the nature of the missing information (fragmented, non-chronological, etc.).\n3.  **Synthesize What's Available:** Even if incomplete, try to offer what *can* be understood from the data.\n4.  **Provide Context/Examples:** Briefly illustrate *how* the information is fragmented.\n5.  **Guide the User:** Suggest what kind of information would be needed to fulfill their request or what the RAG system *can* do with the current data.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can provide a more informative and user-friendly response, even when it cannot fully satisfy the original query.", "repetition": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T04:57:45.876787"}, "rouge_score": 0.052730696798493404, "backward_pass_results": {}, "pipeline_success": true}], "rouge_progression": [0.04339250493096647, 0.052730696798493404], "final_rouge": 0.052730696798493404, "rouge_improvement": 0.009338191867526935}}}

When they speak, they learn that Noork has been living with her brother, Gurn.  With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.  He fights the priest, kills him, and frees Sarna.  They go back to the field, get Rold, and the three of them flee into the jungle.  They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle."], "document_text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\nRaiders of the Second Moon\nBy GENE ELLERMAN\nA strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny worldâ€”to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBeyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrichâ€”whose memory was\ngone completelyâ€”again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood womanâ€”and ugly, my son.\"\n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metalâ€”gold, silver and brassâ€”vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshippedâ€”mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyesâ€”-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchangedâ€”thickenedâ€”as he saw the features of Noork.\n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Raiders of the Second Moon, by Gene Ellerman\n\n", "document_length": 33709, "total_iterations": 2, "metadata": {"batch_id": 0, "dataset": "squality", "setting": "test"}}
