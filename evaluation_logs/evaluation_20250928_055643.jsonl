When they speak, they learn that Noork has been living with her brother, Gurn.  With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.  He fights the priest, kills him, and frees Sarna.  They go back to the field, get Rold, and the three of them flee into the jungle.  They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle."], "document_text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\nRaiders of the Second Moon\nBy GENE ELLERMAN\nA strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world—to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBeyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was\ngone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman—and ugly, my son.\"\n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchanged—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork.\n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Raiders of the Second Moon, by Gene Ellerman\n\n", "document_length": 33709, "total_iterations": 3, "metadata": {"batch_id": 0, "dataset": "squality", "setting": "test"}}

Aim for chunks that represent a coherent thought, scene, event, or logical progression. The `chunk_size` should be large enough to capture sufficient context for entity and relationship extraction but small enough to avoid diluting key information.\n2.  **Granularity for Graph Extraction:** The `chunk_size` directly impacts the granularity of the extracted graph.\n    *   **For plot-centric queries:** The `chunk_size` should facilitate the identification of distinct events, actions, and turning points. Smaller, more focused chunks might be beneficial here to isolate specific plot developments.\n    *   **For entity-centric queries:** Larger chunks might be acceptable if they contain comprehensive descriptions of entities and their attributes.\n3.  **Balancing Information Density:** Avoid chunk sizes that are too large (leading to noisy, unfocused extraction) or too small (leading to fragmented context and missed relationships). The ideal `chunk_size` strikes a balance, ensuring that relevant entities and their connections are likely to appear within a single chunk.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Recognize that optimal `chunk_size` may require experimentation.

Your goal is to generate a sequence of tool calls that effectively traverse a knowledge graph to gather information necessary to construct a comprehensive plot summary.\n\n**Core Principles for Retrieval Planning:**\n\n1.  **Strategic Exploration:**\n    *   Start broadly to identify key entities (characters, locations, significant objects) and potential plot-driving relationships.\n    *   Avoid getting stuck on a single entity. If an initial path yields limited results or becomes repetitive, broaden the search or pivot to other promising entities.\n    *   Prioritize exploring relationships that are indicative of plot progression (e.g., actions, conflicts, goals, motivations, cause-and-effect).\n\n2.  **Relationship-Centric Traversal:**\n    *   Do not solely rely on `get_neighbors`. Actively consider using relationship-specific retrieval functions (e.g., `get_relationships`, `get_nodes_by_relationship`) when appropriate.\n    *   When exploring neighbors, analyze the *types* of relationships connecting entities.

Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative.

Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chunk size of 200 is likely suboptimal for this GraphRAG system, especially considering the critique of the generated graph and its suitability for answering a \"plot\" query. Here's a breakdown of the issues:\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (200) and its Impact:**\n\n1.  **Information Dilution and Context Loss:** A chunk size of 200 might be too large for capturing specific, granular plot elements. If a significant event or character interaction spans across a section of text that is split across multiple 200-token chunks, the LLM responsible for graph extraction from each chunk will receive incomplete context. This fragmentation can lead to:\n    *   **Missed Relationships:** Crucial connections between characters, actions, or events might not be present within a single chunk, preventing their extraction as relationships in the graph.\n    *   **Incomplete Entities:** Key details about a character or object might be split, leading to less informative or duplicated entity nodes.\n    *   **Loss of Narrative Flow:** The sequential nature of plot is inherently lost if related information is scattered across many chunks.\n\n2.  **Inconsistent Granularity for Graph Extraction:** The LLM processing each 200-token chunk is tasked with creating a graph. If the semantic units within the text vary significantly in size, a fixed chunk size can lead to either:\n    *   **Overly Large Chunks:** Containing too much disparate information, overwhelming the LLM and resulting in a noisy or generalized graph. The LLM might struggle to identify the most important entities and relationships, leading to the \"overly broad and unfocused entity extraction\" critique.\n    *   **Overly Small Chunks:** If a key plot point is concentrated in a very small section, a 200-token chunk might include a lot of irrelevant surrounding text, again leading to dilution and potential noise in the extracted graph.\n\n3.  **Impact on Plot-Specific Queries:** The critique highlights a lack of hierarchical and event-based structure. A fixed, relatively large chunk size like 200 exacerbates this. Plot progression often relies on concise, impactful scenes or turning points. If these are diluted by surrounding text within a 200-token chunk, the graph extraction LLM is less likely to identify them as distinct \"events\" or \"actions\" crucial for plot reconstruction. This directly contributes to the critique that the graph lacks an event-based structure and effective", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The current graph construction prompt is overly simplistic and fails to capture the nuances required for a robust plot extraction in a GraphRAG system. The primary issue lies in its **lack of focus on narrative structure and event sequencing**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n1.  **Entity-Centric, Not Plot-Centric Extraction:** The prompt prioritizes identifying *all* entities and their properties without a clear strategy for differentiating crucial plot elements from background details. This leads to an overloaded graph with many entities that might not directly contribute to the plot's progression. The prompt should guide the LLM to identify key actors, antagonists, and significant objects/concepts that drive the narrative.\n\n2.  **Generic Relationship Types:** While the prompt asks for relationships, the types it implicitly encourages are too broad (e.g., \"associated with,\" \"is\"). The resulting graph lacks specific causal, temporal, or sequential relationships essential for understanding a plot. For instance, \"causes,\" \"leads to,\" \"motivates,\" \"precedes,\" or \"follows\" are missing, which are fundamental for reconstructing events in order.\n\n3.  **No Temporal or Sequential Information:** Plots are inherently sequential. The current prompt does not instruct the LLM to capture the order of events or temporal relationships between entities and actions. This absence makes it impossible to reconstruct a coherent narrative timeline.\n\n4.  **Lack of Event/Action Nodes:** The prompt focuses on entities. There's no explicit instruction to create nodes representing events or actions themselves. These event nodes would serve as central hubs, connecting the entities involved, the time of occurrence, and the outcome, which is critical for plot summarization.\n\n5.  **Redundant and Uninformative Properties:** The request for \"properties\" is too general. While it asks for key-value pairs, it doesn't specify *which* properties are narrative-relevant. This can lead to the extraction of trivial information rather than details that advance the plot.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Narrative Elements:** Instruct the LLM to identify characters (protagonist, antagonist), key locations where events occur, and significant objects or concepts central to the plot.\n*   **Introduce Event/Action Nodes:** Modify the prompt to explicitly create \"Event\" or \"Action\" nodes. These nodes should link involved entities, describe the action, and ideally capture causality or sequence.\n*   **Define Specific Relationship Types:** Encourage the use of more precise relationship types that", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The provided retrieval plans demonstrate a common challenge in graph-based question answering: moving from a general query to specific, informative graph traversals. While the initial steps of identifying general entity types like \"Person\" are reasonable, the subsequent plans exhibit several critical weaknesses that hinder effective plot retrieval.\n\n**Critique of the Retrieval Plans:**\n\n1.  **Superficial Entity Identification (Iteration 1):** The first plan correctly identifies the need to find \"Person\" entities. However, simply listing all \"Person\" nodes without any immediate exploration of their connections is a missed opportunity. A plot is defined by relationships and actions, not just the existence of characters.\n\n2.  **Lack of Strategic Depth and Focus (Iterations 2-6):**\n    *   **Premature Focus:** After a broad search, the plan quickly focuses on \"Doctor Karl Von Mark.\" While this is a valid entity, the plot might not solely revolve around him. The subsequent plans continue to explore *only* this entity's neighbors, neglecting other potential plot drivers or characters.\n    *   **Repetitive Exploration:** The plans repeatedly call `get_neighbors` on the same entity without a clear strategy to synthesize the information or expand the search beyond that single node.\n    *   **No Relationship-Centric Exploration:** The plans rarely consider querying for specific relationship types that are crucial for understanding a plot (e.g., \"fights,\" \"travels to,\" \"plans to,\" \"wants to\"). Instead, they rely solely on entity neighbors.\n    *   **Empty Results and Stagnation:** Iterations 4-6 show that the exploration has stalled, yielding no further useful context. This indicates a failure to adapt the strategy when initial explorations don't yield direct answers or when the current path is exhausted.\n\n3.  **Inefficient Information Synthesis:** The plans don't explicitly mention how the retrieved information is being synthesized or used. The repetitive nature of `get_neighbors` calls suggests that the system might not be effectively consolidating information or identifying key narrative threads from the returned subgraphs.\n\n4.  **Missing Direct Plot Information Search:** While the query is \"What is the plot of the story?\", none of the plans directly attempt to search for nodes or relationships containing the keyword \"plot\" until the very last iterations, and even then, only as a last resort.

The LLM defaults to stating it's not present.\n    *   **Prompt Modification:** The prompt needs to guide the LLM to acknowledge the *nature* of the available information and explain *why* it's insufficient for the query.

Here's a breakdown of its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Evaluation of the Current Response:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Honesty and Directness:** The response accurately states that the plot is *not* present in the provided information. This is crucial because it manages user expectations and avoids fabricating information.\n*   **Identifies Available Information:** It correctly points out what *is* present: character relationships and locations. This shows the system understood *some* of the context.\n*   **Provides Specific Examples:** Mentioning \"Doctor Karl Von Mark working to restore Nazidom in a hidden valley\" and \"Stephen Dietrich pursuing Doctor Karl Von Mark\" gives concrete examples of the type of information it *did* find.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Fails to Directly Answer the User's Core Need:** The user asked for the *plot*. While the response explains *why* it can't provide it, it doesn't offer any workaround or further assistance beyond stating the limitation.\n*   **Potentially Misleading (Subtly):** By listing character actions (\"working to restore Nazidom,\" \"pursuing\"), it hints at plot elements, which might lead a user to believe the plot *is* somewhat contained within the information, even if not explicitly stated as a narrative arc.\n*   **Lack of Proactive Help:** A more helpful response would guide the user on what they *could* do next or suggest alternative interpretations of the query.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\nThe goal is to make the response more helpful and user-centric, even when the direct answer isn't available.\n\n1.  **Elaborate on *Why* the Plot is Missing:**\n    *   Instead of just saying \"The provided information does not contain the plot,\" explain *what kind* of information is present that prevents plot extraction.\n    *   **Example Improvement:** \"The provided documents focus on character descriptions, their relationships, and geographical settings rather than a sequential narrative of events. Therefore, a comprehensive plot summary cannot be extracted.\"\n\n2.  **Offer to Summarize the *Available* Information:**\n    *   Since the system identified character relationships and locations, it could offer to synthesize *that* information. This is the closest it can get to a \"plot\" given the constraints.\n    *   **Example Improvement:** \"While a full plot summary is not available, I can describe the known elements based on the text:\n        *   **Key Characters:** Doctor Karl Von Mark, who is actively working to restore Nazidom in a hidden valley, and Stephen Dietrich, who is pursuing Doctor Karl Von Mark.\n        *   **Setting:** A hidden valley is mentioned as the location for Doctor Karl Von Mark's activities.\n        *   **Conflict:** There appears to be a pursuit dynamic between Stephen Dietrich and Doctor Karl Von Mark.\n        *   Would you like me to elaborate on these points?\"\n\n3.  **Guide the User on What Constitutes a \"Plot\":**\n    *   This could help the user refine their query or understand why their current query isn't yielding results.\n    *   **Example Improvement:** \"To provide a plot, the source material would typically need to describe a sequence of events, including a beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. The current information focuses more on establishing characters and their motivations/affiliations.\"\n\n4.  **Suggest Next Steps or Alternative Queries:**\n    *   If the user is looking for *any* narrative, they might be satisfied with a description of the *central conflict* or the *main characters' objectives*.\n    *   **Example Improvement:** \"If you are interested in understanding the core conflict or the main characters' stated goals, I can summarize those aspects based on the available text. Alternatively, if you have specific questions about any of the characters or locations mentioned, I can try to answer those.\"\n\n5.  **Provide a More Structured Response:**\n    *   Use bullet points or clear headings to make the information easier to digest.\n\n**Revised Example Response:**\n\n\"The provided information does not contain a complete plot summary of the story. The documents focus on establishing key characters, their relationships, and certain settings, rather than detailing a narrative sequence of events.\n\nHowever, based on the available text, I can provide the following details:\n\n*   **Central Figures:**\n    *   **Doctor Karl Von Mark:** This character is described as actively working towards the restoration of Nazidom within a hidden valley.\n    *   **Stephen Dietrich:** This character is noted for pursuing Doctor Karl Von Mark.\n*   **Key Conflict Element:** There is an apparent pursuit dynamic between Stephen Dietrich and Doctor Karl Von Mark.\n*   **Setting:** A hidden valley is identified", "repetition": 0, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:57:01.420083"}}

More User-Friendly Explanation of Insufficiency:**\n\nInstead of a technical statement about an \"empty graph,\" rephrase it in a way that directly addresses the user's query.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example:** \"I couldn't find any information about a story's plot in the documents I accessed. The available information seems to be about an empty graph, which doesn't contain details about a narrative.\"\n\n**2. Explicitly State What Information is Missing:**\n\nGuide the user on what kind of information would be needed to answer their question.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example:** \"I was unable to find the plot of a story based on the provided documents. The retrieved information describes an empty graph with no nodes, and therefore, lacks details such as characters, setting, or a sequence of events that would constitute a story's plot. To answer your question, I would need documents that contain narrative descriptions.\"\n\n**3. Suggest Next Steps for the User (if applicable):**\n\nIf the RAG system has access to other potential sources or functionalities, it could suggest them.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example:** \"I couldn't find the plot of a story in the current documents, as they only describe an empty graph. If you have other documents that might contain story details, please provide them. Alternatively, if you're looking for information about graphs, I can help with that.\"\n\n**4. Provide Feedback to the Developer (for RAG system improvement):**\n\nThis is crucial for debugging and enhancing the RAG system itself. The response could include information about the retrieved documents that would be useful for developers.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example (for developer logs/debugging):**\n    ```\n    [RAG System Log/Debug Output]\n    Query: \"What is the plot of the story?\"\n    Retrieved Documents:\n    - Document 1: \"An empty graph is a graph with no vertices or edges.\"\n    - Document 2: \"The concept of an empty graph is fundamental in graph theory.\"\n    Analysis: The retrieved documents are related to graph theory and do not contain any narrative elements. Therefore, the user's query about a story's plot cannot be answered.\n    Recommendation:\n    - Re-evaluate the document retrieval strategy for queries related to narrative content.\n    - Ensure the knowledge base contains documents with story plots.\n    - Consider implementing a fallback mechanism to inform the user about the mismatch between their query and the retrieved content.\n    ```\n\n**5. Hybrid Approach: User-Facing with Developer Hints:**\n\nCombine a user-friendly explanation with some diagnostic information.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example:** \"I was unable to find the plot of a story in the documents I accessed. The retrieved content appears to be about an 'empty graph' with no nodes, which is unrelated to narrative storytelling. This suggests a potential issue with how the system is retrieving information for story-related queries. To answer your question, I would need documents containing narrative details.\"\n\n**Underlying Issues and How to Address Them:**\n\nThe core problem is likely one or a combination of the following:\n\n*   **Poor Retrieval:** The RAG system is retrieving irrelevant documents (e.g., about graph theory) when the user is asking about a story. This could be due to:\n    *   **Keyword Mismatch:** The keywords in the query (\"plot,\" \"", "repetition": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:57:43.302602"}, "backward_pass": {"critiques_generated": true, "total_qa_pairs": 1, "qa_pair_context": {"qa_pair_id": null, "iteration": 0, "is_first_iteration": true}, "optimized_prompts": {"learned_prompt_hyperparameters_graph": "You are an expert AI assistant specializing in optimizing hyperparameters for GraphRAG systems.

The critique points out:\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Granularity:** A chunk size of 300 is too large to focus on atomic events/interactions but too small to capture broader arcs, leading to mixed, fragmented narrative elements within a single chunk. This results in over-specificity and lack of thematic cohesion.\n2.  **Difficulty in Capturing Meaningful Entities/Relationships:** The chunk size may dilute entity significance or lack sufficient context for meaningful connections, potentially explaining generic node types (`\"\"`) and weaker relationship extraction.\n3.  **Impact on Relationship Redundancy/Inconsistency:** Narrative fragmentation across chunks can lead to multiple slightly different descriptions of the same event, causing redundant or inconsistent relationship naming (e.g., variations of \"associated with\").\n\nBased on this critique, your objective is to instruct the LLM to determine optimal `chunk_size` values.

Your primary goal is to understand and extract narrative information, including the plot, characters, settings, and events.\n\n**Your Retrieval Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Narrative Context:** Before directly searching for specific plot points, aim to grasp the story's core elements.\n2.  **Identify Key Entities and Node Types:** Explore the graph to identify prominent node types (e.g., Person, Event, Location, Object) and the most central or frequently connected nodes within these types. This provides a foundation for understanding the story's components.\n3.  **Explore Relationships:** Analyze the relationships *between* identified entities. The plot is often revealed through sequences of events, character interactions, causal links, and thematic connections. Focus on relationships that indicate actions, motivations, or consequences (e.g., `PARTICIPATED_IN`, `CAUSED`, `TRAVELS_TO`, `INTERACTS_WITH`, `RELATES_TO`).\n4.  **Inferential and Pattern-Based Retrieval:** Do not rely on a single, literal keyword like \"plot.\" Instead, infer plot progression by piecing together connected events, character journeys, and the evolution of their states or relationships. Look for temporal sequences and causal chains.\n5.  **Adaptive Exploration:** If an initial exploration yields limited results, do not simply repeat the same query. Adapt your strategy by broadening your search for entities, exploring different relationship types, or focusing on different aspects of the narrative (e.g., character motivations, setting changes).\n6.  **Information Synthesis:** Once relevant nodes and relationships are retrieved, synthesize the information to construct a coherent answer that addresses the user's query.\n\n**Function Usage:**\n\n*   Use `graph.find_nodes(query)` to discover nodes based on keywords, node types, or properties.\n*   Use `graph.get_neighbors(node_id, relationship_type)` to explore connections from a specific node.\n*   Use `graph.get_node_details(node_id)` to retrieve attributes of a node.\n*   Prefer broader searches initially (e.g., searching for common entity types or central nodes) before diving into specific details.\n*   Avoid overly specific or literal keyword searches that might miss indirectly represented information.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nIf a user asks \"What is the plot of the story?\", do", "learned_prompt_graph_builder": "You are an expert Graph Constructor for a GraphRAG system.

Here's a critique focusing on how this chunk size might be improved:\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (300):**\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Granularity Leading to Over-Specificity:** A chunk size of 300 tokens is neither small enough to focus on single events or character interactions, nor large enough to capture broader narrative arcs. This \"in-between\" size likely results in chunks that contain a mix of distinct, yet often unrelated, narrative elements. For instance, a single 300-token chunk could contain a character's internal monologue, a description of a location, and the beginning of a dialogue, all of which might be fragmented across relationships within the graph. This contributes directly to the \"overwhelming specificity\" and \"lack of thematic cohesion\" observed in the graph's relationship types.\n\n2.  **Difficulty in Capturing Meaningful Entities and Relationships:** When a chunk is too large, it can dilute the significance of individual entities and their direct relationships. Conversely, if a chunk is too small, it might not contain enough context to establish meaningful connections. A 300-token chunk might be too large to isolate specific character actions or motivations effectively, leading to weaker or more ambiguous relationships being extracted. This could explain the imbalance in node types, where generic `\"\"` nodes dominate, suggesting that the LLM struggled to identify and categorize specific, plot-relevant entities within each chunk.\n\n3.  **Impact on Relationship Redundancy and Inconsistency:** The current chunk size may lead to the same event or interaction being described differently across multiple chunks, especially if the narrative flows across chunk boundaries. When these slightly different descriptions are processed by the LLM for graph extraction, it can result in redundant or inconsistently named relationships (e.g., variations of \"associated with\" or \"travels towards\"). This fragmentation across chunks makes it harder for the LLM to consistently identify and label relationships, contributing to the \"inconsistent relationship naming and redundancy\" critique.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Experiment with Smaller Chunk Sizes:** Consider significantly smaller chunk sizes (e.g., 100-150 tokens). This would force the LLM to focus on more atomic narrative units, potentially leading to more distinct and clearly defined entities and relationships. This increased granularity could make it easier to later abstract and categorize these relationships into broader", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The current graph construction prompt is overly simplistic and fails to capture the nuances required for a robust plot extraction in a GraphRAG system. The primary issue lies in its **lack of focus on narrative structure and event sequencing**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n1.  **Entity-Centric, Not Plot-Centric Extraction:** The prompt prioritizes identifying *all* entities and their properties without a clear strategy for differentiating crucial plot elements from background details. This leads to an overloaded graph with many entities that might not directly contribute to the plot's progression. The prompt should guide the LLM to identify key actors, antagonists, and significant objects/concepts that drive the narrative.\n\n2.  **Generic Relationship Types:** While the prompt asks for relationships, the types it implicitly encourages are too broad (e.g., \"associated with,\" \"is\"). The resulting graph lacks specific causal, temporal, or sequential relationships essential for understanding a plot. For instance, \"causes,\" \"leads to,\" \"motivates,\" \"precedes,\" or \"follows\" are missing, which are fundamental for reconstructing events in order.\n\n3.  **No Temporal or Sequential Information:** Plots are inherently sequential. The current prompt does not instruct the LLM to capture the order of events or temporal relationships between entities and actions. This absence makes it impossible to reconstruct a coherent narrative timeline.\n\n4.  **Lack of Event/Action Nodes:** The prompt focuses on entities. There's no explicit instruction to create nodes representing events or actions themselves. These event nodes would serve as central hubs, connecting the entities involved, the time of occurrence, and the outcome, which is critical for plot summarization.\n\n5.  **Redundant and Uninformative Properties:** The request for \"properties\" is too general. While it asks for key-value pairs, it doesn't specify *which* properties are narrative-relevant. This can lead to the extraction of trivial information rather than details that advance the plot.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Narrative Elements:** Instruct the LLM to identify characters (protagonist, antagonist), key locations where events occur, and significant objects or concepts central to the plot.\n*   **Introduce Event/Action Nodes:** Modify the prompt to explicitly create \"Event\" or \"Action\" nodes. These nodes should link involved entities, describe the action, and ideally capture causality or sequence.\n*   **Define Specific Relationship Types:** Encourage the use of more precise relationship types that", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The current retrieval plan consistently searches for nodes with the keyword \"plot.\" This approach is flawed because it makes a strong assumption that the graph will contain nodes explicitly labeled as \"plot.\" Stories often depict their plots indirectly through a sequence of events, character interactions, and thematic elements, rather than a single node labeled \"plot.\"\n\nThe repeated retrieval of an \"empty graph\" is a direct consequence of this rigid keyword-centric strategy. It fails to acknowledge that plot information can be distributed across various nodes and relationships within the graph. The plan does not adapt to the lack of results and does not explore alternative ways to infer plot details.\n\nTo improve the retrieval plan, the agent should first engage in a broader exploration of the graph. This could involve:\n\n1.  **Understanding Node Types and Key Entities:** Instead of searching for \"plot,\" the agent should first identify the major entity types (e.g., \"Person,\" \"Location,\" \"Event\") and potentially search for the most common or central nodes. This provides a foundational understanding of the story's components.\n2.  **Exploring Relationships:** Once key entities are identified, the agent can then explore the relationships connecting them. The \"plot\" is often revealed through the sequence and nature of these connections (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"travels towards,\" \"helps\").\n3.  **Inferential Approach:** The agent should look for patterns that suggest a narrative flow rather than a direct keyword match. For example, identifying a sequence of events involving main characters would contribute to understanding the plot.\n\nBy moving away from a single, literal keyword search and adopting a more exploratory and inferential strategy, the agent can better uncover the story's plot even if it's not explicitly labeled.", "answer_generation_critique": "The current prompt is overly verbose and prescriptive, leading to a generated answer that, while factually correct, is unhelpful and fails to adhere to the spirit of a good AI assistant.

The LLM gets bogged down in following these specific, conditional instructions.\n2.  **Lack of Empathy/User-Centricity:** The current prompt prioritizes technical correctness over user experience. It doesn't guide the LLM to communicate *why* information is missing in a way that's easy for a human to understand or suggests what *could* be done.\n3.  **\"Empty Graph\" Technicality:** The prompt doesn't explicitly guide the LLM on how to translate technical graph concepts (like an \"empty graph\") into user-understandable terms when they are irrelevant to the query.\n4.  **No Guidance on System Limitations:** It doesn't instruct the LLM to gracefully handle situations where the *retrieval mechanism itself* failed or returned nonsensical results for the given query.\n\n**Prompt Modification Suggestions:**\n\nThe goal is to simplify, focus on core principles, and empower the LLM to respond more naturally and helpfully, especially in failure cases.\n\n**Revised Prompt Idea:**\n\n```\nYou are an AI assistant tasked with answering user queries by leveraging information extracted from a knowledge graph.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine the plot of the story.", "evaluation_feedback": "**Evaluation of the Response:**\n\nThe RAG system's response is **partially correct but unhelpful**. It accurately identifies that the retrieved information is insufficient to answer the query. However, it fails to provide any actionable feedback or explain *why* the information is insufficient in a way that would help the user or developer improve the system.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Correctness:** The statement \"The retrieved information describes an empty graph with no nodes\" is a factual observation about the *content* of the retrieved documents. If the retrieved documents truly contain no information about a story, then the conclusion that the plot cannot be determined is logically sound.\n*   **Helpfulness:** This is where the response falls short.\n    *   **Lack of Context:** The user asked for the \"plot of the story.\" The response simply states the retrieved information is about an \"empty graph.\" This disconnect is jarring. The RAG system should ideally bridge this gap.\n    *   **No Explanation of Failure:** It doesn't explain *what kind* of information is missing or *why* an \"empty graph\" is irrelevant to the query.\n    *   **No Suggestion for Improvement:** It offers no guidance on what the user or developer could do differently.\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n\nThe goal is to make the response more informative and actionable, even when the RAG system cannot fulfill the original request.\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, ranging from simple to more sophisticated:\n\n**1. More User-Friendly Explanation of Insufficiency:**\n\nInstead of a technical statement about an \"empty graph,\" rephrase it in a way that directly addresses the user's query.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example:** \"I couldn't find any information about a story's plot in the documents I accessed. The available information seems to be about an empty graph, which doesn't contain details about a narrative.\"\n\n**2. Explicitly State What Information is Missing:**\n\nGuide the user on what kind of information would be needed to answer their question.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example:** \"I was unable to find the plot of a story based on the provided documents. The retrieved information describes an empty graph with no nodes, and therefore, lacks details such as characters, setting, or a sequence of events that would constitute a story's plot. To answer your question, I would need documents that contain narrative descriptions.\"\n\n**3. Suggest Next Steps for the User (if applicable):**\n\nIf the RAG system has access to other potential sources or functionalities, it could suggest them.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example:** \"I couldn't find the plot of a story in the current documents, as they only describe an empty graph. If you have other documents that might contain story details, please provide them. Alternatively, if you're looking for information about graphs, I can help with that.\"\n\n**4. Provide Feedback to the Developer (for RAG system improvement):**\n\nThis is crucial for debugging and enhancing the RAG system itself. The response could include information about the retrieved documents that would be useful for developers.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example (for developer logs/debugging):**\n    ```\n    [RAG System Log/Debug Output]\n    Query: \"What is the plot of the story?\"\n    Retrieved Documents:\n    - Document 1: \"An empty graph is a graph with no vertices or edges.\"\n    - Document 2: \"The concept of an empty graph is fundamental in graph theory.\"\n    Analysis: The retrieved documents are related to graph theory and do not contain any narrative elements. Therefore, the user's query about a story's plot cannot be answered.\n    Recommendation:\n    - Re-evaluate the document retrieval strategy for queries related to narrative content.\n    - Ensure the knowledge base contains documents with story plots.\n    - Consider implementing a fallback mechanism to inform the user about the mismatch between their query and the retrieved content.\n    ```\n\n**5. Hybrid Approach: User-Facing with Developer Hints:**\n\nCombine a user-friendly explanation with some diagnostic information.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example:** \"I was unable to find the plot of a story in the documents I accessed. The retrieved content appears to be about an 'empty graph' with no nodes, which is unrelated to narrative storytelling. This suggests a potential issue with how the system is retrieving information for story-related queries. To answer your question, I would need documents containing narrative details.\"\n\n**Underlying Issues and How to Address Them:**\n\nThe core problem is likely one or a combination of the following:\n\n*   **Poor Retrieval:** The RAG system is retrieving irrelevant documents (e.g., about graph theory) when the user is asking about a story. This could be due to:\n    *   **Keyword Mismatch:** The keywords in the query (\"plot,\" \"", "repetition": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:57:43.302602"}}

Prioritize \"Plot\" Keywords in Retrieval (Retrieval Strategy)\n\nThe RAG system should be designed to prioritize documents or passages that explicitly discuss plot, summary, narrative, storyline, or overarching events.

Here's a breakdown of its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Evaluation of the Current Response:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Honesty and Directness:** The response accurately states that the plot is *not* present in the provided information. This is crucial because it manages user expectations and avoids fabricating information.\n*   **Identifies Available Information:** It correctly points out what *is* present: character relationships and locations.

Smaller, more focused chunks might be beneficial here to isolate specific plot developments.\n    *   **For entity-centric queries:** Larger chunks might be acceptable if they contain comprehensive descriptions of entities and their attributes.\n3.  **Balancing Information Density:** Avoid chunk sizes that are too large (leading to noisy, unfocused extraction) or too small (leading to fragmented context and missed relationships). The ideal `chunk_size` strikes a balance, ensuring that relevant entities and their connections are likely to appear within a single chunk.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Recognize that optimal `chunk_size` may require experimentation.

Your goal is to generate a sequence of tool calls that effectively traverse a knowledge graph to gather information necessary to construct a comprehensive plot summary.\n\n**Core Principles for Retrieval Planning:**\n\n1.  **Strategic Exploration:**\n    *   Start broadly to identify key entities (characters, locations, significant objects) and potential plot-driving relationships.\n    *   Avoid getting stuck on a single entity. If an initial path yields limited results or becomes repetitive, broaden the search or pivot to other promising entities.\n    *   Prioritize exploring relationships that are indicative of plot progression (e.g., actions, conflicts, goals, motivations, cause-and-effect).\n\n2.  **Relationship-Centric Traversal:**\n    *   Do not solely rely on `get_neighbors`. Actively consider using relationship-specific retrieval functions (e.g., `get_relationships`, `get_nodes_by_relationship`) when appropriate.\n    *   When exploring neighbors, analyze the *types* of relationships connecting entities.

Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (200) and its Impact:**\n\n1.  **Information Dilution and Context Loss:** A chunk size of 200 might be too large for capturing specific, granular plot elements. If a significant event or character interaction spans across a section of text that is split across multiple 200-token chunks, the LLM responsible for graph extraction from each chunk will receive incomplete context. This fragmentation can lead to:\n    *   **Missed Relationships:** Crucial connections between characters, actions, or events might not be present within a single chunk, preventing their extraction as relationships in the graph.\n    *   **Incomplete Entities:** Key details about a character or object might be split, leading to less informative or duplicated entity nodes.\n    *   **Loss of Narrative Flow:** The sequential nature of plot is inherently lost if related information is scattered across many chunks.\n\n2.  **Inconsistent Granularity for Graph Extraction:** The LLM processing each 200-token chunk is tasked with creating a graph. If the semantic units within the text vary significantly in size, a fixed chunk size can lead to either:\n    *   **Overly Large Chunks:** Containing too much disparate information, overwhelming the LLM and resulting in a noisy or generalized graph. The LLM might struggle to identify the most important entities and relationships, leading to the \"overly broad and unfocused entity extraction\" critique.\n    *   **Overly Small Chunks:** If a key plot point is concentrated in a very small section, a 200-token chunk might include a lot of irrelevant surrounding text, again leading to dilution and potential noise in the extracted graph.\n\n3.  **Impact on Plot-Specific Queries:** The critique highlights a lack of hierarchical and event-based structure. A fixed, relatively large chunk size like 200 exacerbates this. Plot progression often relies on concise, impactful scenes or turning points. If these are diluted by surrounding text within a 200-token chunk, the graph extraction LLM is less likely to identify them as distinct \"events\" or \"actions\" crucial for plot reconstruction. This directly contributes to the critique that the graph lacks an event-based structure and effective", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The current graph construction prompt is overly simplistic and fails to capture the nuances required for a robust plot extraction in a GraphRAG system. The primary issue lies in its **lack of focus on narrative structure and event sequencing**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n1.  **Entity-Centric, Not Plot-Centric Extraction:** The prompt prioritizes identifying *all* entities and their properties without a clear strategy for differentiating crucial plot elements from background details. This leads to an overloaded graph with many entities that might not directly contribute to the plot's progression. The prompt should guide the LLM to identify key actors, antagonists, and significant objects/concepts that drive the narrative.\n\n2.  **Generic Relationship Types:** While the prompt asks for relationships, the types it implicitly encourages are too broad (e.g., \"associated with,\" \"is\"). The resulting graph lacks specific causal, temporal, or sequential relationships essential for understanding a plot. For instance, \"causes,\" \"leads to,\" \"motivates,\" \"precedes,\" or \"follows\" are missing, which are fundamental for reconstructing events in order.\n\n3.  **No Temporal or Sequential Information:** Plots are inherently sequential. The current prompt does not instruct the LLM to capture the order of events or temporal relationships between entities and actions. This absence makes it impossible to reconstruct a coherent narrative timeline.\n\n4.  **Lack of Event/Action Nodes:** The prompt focuses on entities. There's no explicit instruction to create nodes representing events or actions themselves. These event nodes would serve as central hubs, connecting the entities involved, the time of occurrence, and the outcome, which is critical for plot summarization.\n\n5.  **Redundant and Uninformative Properties:** The request for \"properties\" is too general. While it asks for key-value pairs, it doesn't specify *which* properties are narrative-relevant. This can lead to the extraction of trivial information rather than details that advance the plot.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Narrative Elements:** Instruct the LLM to identify characters (protagonist, antagonist), key locations where events occur, and significant objects or concepts central to the plot.\n*   **Introduce Event/Action Nodes:** Modify the prompt to explicitly create \"Event\" or \"Action\" nodes. These nodes should link involved entities, describe the action, and ideally capture causality or sequence.\n*   **Define Specific Relationship Types:** Encourage the use of more precise relationship types that", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The provided retrieval plans demonstrate a common challenge in graph-based question answering: moving from a general query to specific, informative graph traversals. While the initial steps of identifying general entity types like \"Person\" are reasonable, the subsequent plans exhibit several critical weaknesses that hinder effective plot retrieval.\n\n**Critique of the Retrieval Plans:**\n\n1.  **Superficial Entity Identification (Iteration 1):** The first plan correctly identifies the need to find \"Person\" entities. However, simply listing all \"Person\" nodes without any immediate exploration of their connections is a missed opportunity. A plot is defined by relationships and actions, not just the existence of characters.\n\n2.  **Lack of Strategic Depth and Focus (Iterations 2-6):**\n    *   **Premature Focus:** After a broad search, the plan quickly focuses on \"Doctor Karl Von Mark.\" While this is a valid entity, the plot might not solely revolve around him. The subsequent plans continue to explore *only* this entity's neighbors, neglecting other potential plot drivers or characters.\n    *   **Repetitive Exploration:** The plans repeatedly call `get_neighbors` on the same entity without a clear strategy to synthesize the information or expand the search beyond that single node.\n    *   **No Relationship-Centric Exploration:** The plans rarely consider querying for specific relationship types that are crucial for understanding a plot (e.g., \"fights,\" \"travels to,\" \"plans to,\" \"wants to\"). Instead, they rely solely on entity neighbors.\n    *   **Empty Results and Stagnation:** Iterations 4-6 show that the exploration has stalled, yielding no further useful context. This indicates a failure to adapt the strategy when initial explorations don't yield direct answers or when the current path is exhausted.\n\n3.  **Inefficient Information Synthesis:** The plans don't explicitly mention how the retrieved information is being synthesized or used. The repetitive nature of `get_neighbors` calls suggests that the system might not be effectively consolidating information or identifying key narrative threads from the returned subgraphs.\n\n4.  **Missing Direct Plot Information Search:** While the query is \"What is the plot of the story?\", none of the plans directly attempt to search for nodes or relationships containing the keyword \"plot\" until the very last iterations, and even then, only as a last resort.

The LLM defaults to stating it's not present.\n    *   **Prompt Modification:** The prompt needs to guide the LLM to acknowledge the *nature* of the available information and explain *why* it's insufficient for the query. It should also encourage offering what *is* available.\n\n    *   **Suggested Prompt Addition:**\n        \"If the provided information does not directly contain the answer to the query, first explain *why* by describing the type of information that *is* present (e.g., character relationships, locations, events).

It accurately identifies that the retrieved information is insufficient to answer the query. However, it fails to provide any actionable feedback or explain *why* the information is insufficient in a way that would help the user or developer improve the system.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Correctness:** The statement \"The retrieved information describes an empty graph with no nodes\" is a factual observation about the *content* of the retrieved documents. If the retrieved documents truly contain no information about a story, then the conclusion that the plot cannot be determined is logically sound.\n*   **Helpfulness:** This is where the response falls short.\n    *   **Lack of Context:** The user asked for the \"plot of the story.\" The response simply states the retrieved information is about an \"empty graph.\" This disconnect is jarring. The RAG system should ideally bridge this gap.\n    *   **No Explanation of Failure:** It doesn't explain *what kind* of information is missing or *why* an \"empty graph\" is irrelevant to the query.\n    *   **No Suggestion for Improvement:** It offers no guidance on what the user or developer could do differently.\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n\nThe goal is to make the response more informative and actionable, even when the RAG system cannot fulfill the original request.\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, ranging from simple to more sophisticated:\n\n**1. More User-Friendly Explanation of Insufficiency:**\n\nInstead of a technical statement about an \"empty graph,\" rephrase it in a way that directly addresses the user's query.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example:** \"I couldn't find any information about a story's plot in the documents I accessed. The available information seems to be about an empty graph, which doesn't contain details about a narrative.\"\n\n**2. Explicitly State What Information is Missing:**\n\nGuide the user on what kind of information would be needed to answer their question.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example:** \"I was unable to find the plot of a story based on the provided documents. The retrieved information describes an empty graph with no nodes, and therefore, lacks details such as characters, setting, or a sequence of events that would constitute a story's plot. To answer your question, I would need documents that contain narrative descriptions.\"\n\n**3. Suggest Next Steps for the User (if applicable):**\n\nIf the RAG system has access to other potential sources or functionalities, it could suggest them.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example:** \"I couldn't find the plot of a story in the current documents, as they only describe an empty graph. If you have other documents that might contain story details, please provide them. Alternatively, if you're looking for information about graphs, I can help with that.\"\n\n**4. Provide Feedback to the Developer (for RAG system improvement):**\n\nThis is crucial for debugging and enhancing the RAG system itself. The response could include information about the retrieved documents that would be useful for developers.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example (for developer logs/debugging):**\n    ```\n    [RAG System Log/Debug Output]\n    Query: \"What is the plot of the story?\"\n    Retrieved Documents:\n    - Document 1: \"An empty graph is a graph with no vertices or edges.\"\n    - Document 2: \"The concept of an empty graph is fundamental in graph theory.\"\n    Analysis: The retrieved documents are related to graph theory and do not contain any narrative elements. Therefore, the user's query about a story's plot cannot be answered.\n    Recommendation:\n    - Re-evaluate the document retrieval strategy for queries related to narrative content.\n    - Ensure the knowledge base contains documents with story plots.\n    - Consider implementing a fallback mechanism to inform the user about the mismatch between their query and the retrieved content.\n    ```\n\n**5. Hybrid Approach: User-Facing with Developer Hints:**\n\nCombine a user-friendly explanation with some diagnostic information.\n\n*   **Improved Response Example:** \"I was unable to find the plot of a story in the documents I accessed. The retrieved content appears to be about an 'empty graph' with no nodes, which is unrelated to narrative storytelling. This suggests a potential issue with how the system is retrieving information for story-related queries. To answer your question, I would need documents containing narrative details.\"\n\n**Underlying Issues and How to Address Them:**\n\nThe core problem is likely one or a combination of the following:\n\n*   **Poor Retrieval:** The RAG system is retrieving irrelevant documents (e.g., about graph theory) when the user is asking about a story. This could be due to:\n    *   **Keyword Mismatch:** The keywords in the query (\"plot,\" \"", "repetition": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:57:43.302602"}, "rouge_score": 0.031999999999999994, "backward_pass_results": {"critiques_generated": true, "total_qa_pairs": 1, "qa_pair_context": {"qa_pair_id": null, "iteration": 0, "is_first_iteration": true}, "optimized_prompts": {"learned_prompt_hyperparameters_graph": "You are an expert AI assistant specializing in optimizing hyperparameters for GraphRAG systems. Your task is to analyze a given critique of current hyperparameter settings and provide precise instructions to an LLM for selecting better hyperparameters.\n\nYou have been provided with a critique of the `chunk_size` hyperparameter, specifically highlighting issues arising from a `chunk_size` of 300. The critique points out:\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Granularity:** A chunk size of 300 is too large to focus on atomic events/interactions but too small to capture broader arcs, leading to mixed, fragmented narrative elements within a single chunk. This results in over-specificity and lack of thematic cohesion.\n2.  **Difficulty in Capturing Meaningful Entities/Relationships:** The chunk size may dilute entity significance or lack sufficient context for meaningful connections, potentially explaining generic node types (`\"\"`) and weaker relationship extraction.\n3.  **Impact on Relationship Redundancy/Inconsistency:** Narrative fragmentation across chunks can lead to multiple slightly different descriptions of the same event, causing redundant or inconsistent relationship naming (e.g., variations of \"associated with\").\n\nBased on this critique, your objective is to instruct the LLM to determine optimal `chunk_size` values. The LLM should consider the following when making recommendations:\n\n*   **Granularity and Specificity:** The LLM must balance capturing sufficient context for meaningful relationships against preventing over-specificity and narrative fragmentation.\n*   **Entity and Relationship Clarity:** Prioritize chunk sizes that facilitate the clear identification and extraction of distinct entities and their direct, unambiguous relationships. Avoid chunk sizes that dilute context or force the model to infer weakly supported connections.\n*   **Narrative Cohesion:** Recommend chunk sizes that minimize the likelihood of splitting critical narrative elements or events across multiple chunks, thereby reducing redundancy and inconsistency in relationship naming.\n*   **Exploration of Smaller Chunks:** Consider exploring significantly smaller chunk sizes (e.g., 100-150 tokens) to encourage focus on more atomic narrative units, which may lead to more distinct and clearly defined graph elements.\n*   **Iterative Refinement:** Understand that optimal `chunk_size` may vary based on the specific dataset and narrative structure.

The plot is often revealed through sequences of events, character interactions, causal links, and thematic connections. Focus on relationships that indicate actions, motivations, or consequences (e.g., `PARTICIPATED_IN`, `CAUSED`, `TRAVELS_TO`, `INTERACTS_WITH`, `RELATES_TO`).\n4.  **Inferential and Pattern-Based Retrieval:** Do not rely on a single, literal keyword like \"plot.\" Instead, infer plot progression by piecing together connected events, character journeys, and the evolution of their states or relationships. Look for temporal sequences and causal chains.\n5.  **Adaptive Exploration:** If an initial exploration yields limited results, do not simply repeat the same query. Adapt your strategy by broadening your search for entities, exploring different relationship types, or focusing on different aspects of the narrative (e.g., character motivations, setting changes).\n6.  **Information Synthesis:** Once relevant nodes and relationships are retrieved, synthesize the information to construct a coherent answer that addresses the user's query.\n\n**Function Usage:**\n\n*   Use `graph.find_nodes(query)` to discover nodes based on keywords, node types, or properties.\n*   Use `graph.get_neighbors(node_id, relationship_type)` to explore connections from a specific node.\n*   Use `graph.get_node_details(node_id)` to retrieve attributes of a node.\n*   Prefer broader searches initially (e.g., searching for common entity types or central nodes) before diving into specific details.\n*   Avoid overly specific or literal keyword searches that might miss indirectly represented information.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nIf a user asks \"What is the plot of the story?\", do", "learned_prompt_graph_builder": "You are an expert Graph Constructor for a GraphRAG system. Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chunk size of 300 appears to be a contributing factor to the identified issues in graph construction and retrieval. Here's a critique focusing on how this chunk size might be improved:\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (300):**\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Granularity Leading to Over-Specificity:** A chunk size of 300 tokens is neither small enough to focus on single events or character interactions, nor large enough to capture broader narrative arcs. This \"in-between\" size likely results in chunks that contain a mix of distinct, yet often unrelated, narrative elements. For instance, a single 300-token chunk could contain a character's internal monologue, a description of a location, and the beginning of a dialogue, all of which might be fragmented across relationships within the graph. This contributes directly to the \"overwhelming specificity\" and \"lack of thematic cohesion\" observed in the graph's relationship types.\n\n2.  **Difficulty in Capturing Meaningful Entities and Relationships:** When a chunk is too large, it can dilute the significance of individual entities and their direct relationships. Conversely, if a chunk is too small, it might not contain enough context to establish meaningful connections. A 300-token chunk might be too large to isolate specific character actions or motivations effectively, leading to weaker or more ambiguous relationships being extracted. This could explain the imbalance in node types, where generic `\"\"` nodes dominate, suggesting that the LLM struggled to identify and categorize specific, plot-relevant entities within each chunk.\n\n3.  **Impact on Relationship Redundancy and Inconsistency:** The current chunk size may lead to the same event or interaction being described differently across multiple chunks, especially if the narrative flows across chunk boundaries. When these slightly different descriptions are processed by the LLM for graph extraction, it can result in redundant or inconsistently named relationships (e.g., variations of \"associated with\" or \"travels towards\"). This fragmentation across chunks makes it harder for the LLM to consistently identify and label relationships, contributing to the \"inconsistent relationship naming and redundancy\" critique.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Experiment with Smaller Chunk Sizes:** Consider significantly smaller chunk sizes (e.g., 100-150 tokens). This would force the LLM to focus on more atomic narrative units, potentially leading to more distinct and clearly defined entities and relationships. This increased granularity could make it easier to later abstract and categorize these relationships into broader", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The current graph construction prompt is overly simplistic and fails to capture the nuances required for a robust plot extraction in a GraphRAG system. The primary issue lies in its **lack of focus on narrative structure and event sequencing**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n1.  **Entity-Centric, Not Plot-Centric Extraction:** The prompt prioritizes identifying *all* entities and their properties without a clear strategy for differentiating crucial plot elements from background details. This leads to an overloaded graph with many entities that might not directly contribute to the plot's progression. The prompt should guide the LLM to identify key actors, antagonists, and significant objects/concepts that drive the narrative.\n\n2.  **Generic Relationship Types:** While the prompt asks for relationships, the types it implicitly encourages are too broad (e.g., \"associated with,\" \"is\"). The resulting graph lacks specific causal, temporal, or sequential relationships essential for understanding a plot. For instance, \"causes,\" \"leads to,\" \"motivates,\" \"precedes,\" or \"follows\" are missing, which are fundamental for reconstructing events in order.\n\n3.  **No Temporal or Sequential Information:** Plots are inherently sequential. The current prompt does not instruct the LLM to capture the order of events or temporal relationships between entities and actions. This absence makes it impossible to reconstruct a coherent narrative timeline.\n\n4.  **Lack of Event/Action Nodes:** The prompt focuses on entities. There's no explicit instruction to create nodes representing events or actions themselves. These event nodes would serve as central hubs, connecting the entities involved, the time of occurrence, and the outcome, which is critical for plot summarization.\n\n5.  **Redundant and Uninformative Properties:** The request for \"properties\" is too general. While it asks for key-value pairs, it doesn't specify *which* properties are narrative-relevant. This can lead to the extraction of trivial information rather than details that advance the plot.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Narrative Elements:** Instruct the LLM to identify characters (protagonist, antagonist), key locations where events occur, and significant objects or concepts central to the plot.\n*   **Introduce Event/Action Nodes:** Modify the prompt to explicitly create \"Event\" or \"Action\" nodes. These nodes should link involved entities, describe the action, and ideally capture causality or sequence.\n*   **Define Specific Relationship Types:** Encourage the use of more precise relationship types that", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The current retrieval plan consistently searches for nodes with the keyword \"plot.\" This approach is flawed because it makes a strong assumption that the graph will contain nodes explicitly labeled as \"plot.\" Stories often depict their plots indirectly through a sequence of events, character interactions, and thematic elements, rather than a single node labeled \"plot.\"\n\nThe repeated retrieval of an \"empty graph\" is a direct consequence of this rigid keyword-centric strategy. It fails to acknowledge that plot information can be distributed across various nodes and relationships within the graph. The plan does not adapt to the lack of results and does not explore alternative ways to infer plot details.\n\nTo improve the retrieval plan, the agent should first engage in a broader exploration of the graph. This could involve:\n\n1.  **Understanding Node Types and Key Entities:** Instead of searching for \"plot,\" the agent should first identify the major entity types (e.g., \"Person,\" \"Location,\" \"Event\") and potentially search for the most common or central nodes. This provides a foundational understanding of the story's components.\n2.  **Exploring Relationships:** Once key entities are identified, the agent can then explore the relationships connecting them. The \"plot\" is often revealed through the sequence and nature of these connections (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"travels towards,\" \"helps\").\n3.  **Inferential Approach:** The agent should look for patterns that suggest a narrative flow rather than a direct keyword match. For example, identifying a sequence of events involving main characters would contribute to understanding the plot.\n\nBy moving away from a single, literal keyword search and adopting a more exploratory and inferential strategy, the agent can better uncover the story's plot even if it's not explicitly labeled.", "answer_generation_critique": "The current prompt is overly verbose and prescriptive, leading to a generated answer that, while factually correct, is unhelpful and fails to adhere to the spirit of a good AI assistant. The feedback highlights key areas for improvement, which can be addressed by revising the prompt.\n\nHere's a critique and specific prompt modification suggestions:\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Overly Complex Instructions:** The prompt's detailed, multi-point structure, especially \"Handling Insufficient or Mismatched Information\" and \"Synthesizing Related Information,\" is likely contributing to the rigid and unhelpful output. The LLM gets bogged down in following these specific, conditional instructions.\n2.  **Lack of Empathy/User-Centricity:** The current prompt prioritizes technical correctness over user experience. It doesn't guide the LLM to communicate *why* information is missing in a way that's easy for a human to understand or suggests what *could* be done.\n3.  **\"Empty Graph\" Technicality:** The prompt doesn't explicitly guide the LLM on how to translate technical graph concepts (like an \"empty graph\") into user-understandable terms when they are irrelevant to the query.\n4.  **No Guidance on System Limitations:** It doesn't instruct the LLM to gracefully handle situations where the *retrieval mechanism itself* failed or returned nonsensical results for the given query.\n\n**Prompt Modification Suggestions:**\n\nThe goal is to simplify, focus on core principles, and empower the LLM to respond more naturally and helpfully, especially in failure cases.\n\n**Revised Prompt Idea:**\n\n```\nYou are an AI assistant tasked with answering user queries by leveraging information extracted from a knowledge graph.

However, it falls short of directly answering the user's core question about the \"plot of the story.\"\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Identifies relevant entities:** The response correctly identifies characters like the Invisible Man, Gurn, Misty Ones, Noork, Ud, and Vasads, suggesting it has processed some content related to these entities.\n*   **Extracts specific details:** It pulls out concrete actions and characteristics associated with these characters (e.g., instructions to Gurn, trapping Misty Ones, communication, invisible mantles). This shows it can extract factual information.\n*   **Acknowledges limitations:** The response is honest about its inability to provide the \"overall plot,\" which is crucial for managing user expectations.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Fails to synthesize into a narrative:** The core of the query is \"the plot of the story.\" The response provides a list of disconnected events and character interactions rather than a coherent narrative summary. It doesn't explain *why* these interactions are happening or what their purpose is within a larger storyline.\n*   **Assumes the retrieved information *is* the plot:** The response presents the extracted details as if they *could* constitute the plot, but then concludes it can't answer the question. This creates a slight contradiction. If these are the only details found, the system should explicitly state that it found *elements* but not a cohesive plot summary.\n*   **Lack of context:** The retrieved details are presented without any overarching context. We don't know the setting, the primary conflict, the goals of the characters, or the resolution.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nHere are several ways to improve the RAG system's response, ranging from simple adjustments to more advanced retrieval strategies:\n\n### 1. Explicitly State What Was Found and What Was Missing (Enhanced Clarity)\n\nInstead of just saying \"I found information about...\" and then \"I could not find details regarding the overall plot...\", the system can be more precise.\n\n**Improved Response Example:**\n\n> \"I found information detailing specific events and character interactions within the story, including:\n>\n> *   The Invisible Man instructing Gurn not to fear demons.\n> *   The ability to trap and skin the Misty Ones.\n> *   Communication occurring between the Invisible Man, Noork, and Ud.\n> *   Vasads concealing themselves with invisible mantles.\n>\n> While these details provide glimpses into the world and its inhabitants, they do not form a cohesive summary of the *overall plot* or the main narrative arc of the story. Therefore, I cannot provide a complete plot description based on the information I was able to retrieve.\"\n\n### 2. Prioritize \"Plot\" Keywords in Retrieval (Retrieval Strategy)\n\nThe RAG system should be designed to prioritize documents or passages that explicitly discuss plot, summary, narrative, storyline, or overarching events. This might involve:\n\n*   **Document Chunking and Metadata:** If documents are chunked, chunks that contain summary-like language or are explicitly labeled as plot summaries should be given higher weight.\n*   **Query Expansion:** Expand the user's query with terms like \"summary,\" \"storyline,\" \"narrative,\" \"main events,\" \"what happens in the story,\" etc., to better match relevant content.\n*   **Document Ranking:** If the retrieval system ranks documents, it should favor those that are more likely to contain a plot summary.\n\n### 3. Synthesize Retrieved Snippets into a Narrative (Generation Strategy)\n\nIf the RAG system has access to multiple relevant snippets, it should attempt to weave them together into a more narrative form, even if it's fragmented.\n\n**How to achieve this:**\n\n*   **Identify a potential protagonist/antagonist:** Based on the frequency and nature of mentions, try to infer who the central figure(s) might be.\n*   **Look for causal relationships:** Are any of the retrieved actions a direct cause or effect of another?\n*   **Infer a conflict:** The mention of \"demons\" and \"trapping\" suggests potential conflict.\n*   **Add transitional phrases:** Use phrases like \"The story seems to involve...\", \"It appears that...\", \"Key elements include...\"\n\n**Example of attempting synthesis (even if incomplete):**\n\n> \"Based on the information retrieved, the story seems to involve the Invisible Man and his interactions with various beings. He appears to be giving instructions to Gurn, advising him on dealing with demons. There's also an indication of conflict or dominance over 'Misty Ones,' as they can be trapped and skinned. Furthermore, communication occurs between the Invisible Man, Noork, and Ud, suggesting these characters are part of the same narrative.

When they speak, they learn that Noork has been living with her brother, Gurn.  With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.  He fights the priest, kills him, and frees Sarna.  They go back to the field, get Rold, and the three of them flee into the jungle.  They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle."], "document_text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\nRaiders of the Second Moon\nBy GENE ELLERMAN\nA strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world—to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBeyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was\ngone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman—and ugly, my son.\"\n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchanged—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork.\n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Raiders of the Second Moon, by Gene Ellerman\n\n", "document_length": 33709, "total_iterations": 3, "metadata": {"batch_id": 0, "dataset": "squality", "setting": "test"}}
