When they speak, they learn that Noork has been living with her brother, Gurn.  With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.  He fights the priest, kills him, and frees Sarna.  They go back to the field, get Rold, and the three of them flee into the jungle.  They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle."], "document_text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\nRaiders of the Second Moon\nBy GENE ELLERMAN\nA strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world—to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBeyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was\ngone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman—and ugly, my son.\"\n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchanged—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork.\n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Raiders of the Second Moon, by Gene Ellerman\n\n", "document_length": 33709, "total_iterations": 2, "metadata": {"batch_id": 0, "dataset": "squality", "setting": "test"}}

However, it is **fragmented, lacks coherence, and omits crucial context**, making it difficult to understand the actual narrative. It feels more like a collection of disconnected facts than a cohesive plot summary.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Identifies key characters:** Mentions Doctor Karl Von Mark and Stephen Dietrich.\n*   **Hints at a central conflict:** Suggests Von Mark is a criminal trying to restore Nazidom, and Dietrich is tracking him.\n*   **Includes a sci-fi element:** Mentions spaceships and cosmic matter, indicating a genre.\n\n**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Cohesion and Flow:** The sentences are presented as independent statements without smooth transitions. The reader is left to piece together the connections, which is not the purpose of a plot summary.\n    *   **Improvement:** Connect the ideas logically. For example, how does Dietrich's lost memory relate to tracking Von Mark? How does Von Mark's plan in Africa lead to him being trapped in space?\n\n2.  **Missing Crucial Context:**\n    *   **\"Last of the Axis criminals at large\":** This is a significant detail that needs to be explained. Why are they \"at large\"? What does \"Axis\" refer to in this context (likely WWII, but it should be clearer)?\n    *   **\"Restore Nazidom\":** This is a highly charged and specific goal. The response doesn't explain *how* Von Mark intends to do this or the significance of this goal within the story.\n    *   **\"Dietrich's memory was gone\":** This is a major plot point and a significant impediment. How does he track Von Mark despite this? Is there a reason his memory is gone? This needs to be integrated into the narrative.\n    *   **\"Young American pilot\":** Who is this pilot? What is their role? Are they an ally or a captive? Their presence is very abrupt.\n    *   **\"Small blob of cosmic matter\":** This is very vague. Is it a planetoid, an asteroid, a space station, or something else entirely?\n\n3.  **Vagueness and Imprecision:**\n    *   **\"Worked in a hidden valley in Africa\":** This sets a scene, but it's not very descriptive or engaging.\n    *   **\"Built crude spaceships\":** \"Crude\" is a descriptor, but it doesn't tell us much about the *purpose* or *nature* of these ships in the context of the story.\n    *   **\"Trapped on a small blob of cosmic matter\":** As mentioned, this is very unclear.\n\n4.  **Incomplete Plot:** The response feels like it's only covering the beginning or a very specific, isolated part of the story. A plot summary should ideally cover the main conflict, rising action, climax, and resolution (or at least hint at them). This response only offers a setup.\n\n5.  **Ambiguity about the Story's Core Conflict:** While it mentions Von Mark's goal and Dietrich's pursuit, it doesn't clearly articulate what the *main challenge* is for the protagonists or what the stakes are.\n\n**Specific Suggestions for Improvement (incorporating the above points):**\n\nTo improve the response, the RAG system should aim to provide a more narrative and informative summary. Here's how the response could be rewritten to be more effective:\n\n**Example of an Improved Response (Hypothetical):**\n\n\"The story follows the pursuit of Doctor Karl Von Mark, the last surviving high-ranking Nazi war criminal still at large after World War II. Von Mark has established a secret base in Africa, where he is using stolen resources and advanced technology to construct rudimentary spaceships with the ultimate goal of reviving Nazidom. Unbeknownst to Von Mark, he is being tracked by Stephen Dietrich, a former associate who has lost his memory. Despite his amnesia, Dietrich finds himself drawn into a dangerous game of cat and mouse with Von Mark. The narrative escalates when both Von Mark and Dietrich find themselves stranded together on a small, uncharted celestial body, a consequence of Von Mark's increasingly desperate attempts to escape and launch his ambitious plan, with a young American pilot caught in the middle of their conflict.\"\n\n**Key Changes Made in the Example:**\n\n*   **Contextualized \"Axis criminals\":** Specified \"last surviving high-ranking Nazi war criminal after World War II.\"\n*   **Clarified Von Mark's goal:** Explained *what* Nazidom is and that he's trying to \"revive\" it, hinting at a grand, dangerous scheme.\n*   **Integrated Dietrich's amnesia:** Connected his memory loss to his pursuit, suggesting an intrinsic drive or perhaps external influence.\n*   **Improved flow:** Used transition words and phrases (\"Unbeknownst to Von Mark,\" \"Despite his amnesia,\" \"The narrative escalates when\") to link sentences.\n*   **Elaborated on the \"blob\":** Used \"uncharted celestial body\" for a slightly more descriptive, albeit still potentially vague, term.\n*   **Hinted at rising action:** Mentioned them being \"stranded together\" as a turning point.\n*   **Addressed the pilot's situation:** Positioned the pilot as \"caught in the middle.\"\n\nBy addressing these points, the RAG system can move from providing disjointed facts to generating a more comprehensive, understandable, and engaging plot summary.", "repetition": 0, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T04:40:21.982429"}, "backward_pass": {"critiques_generated": true, "total_qa_pairs": 1, "qa_pair_context": {"qa_pair_id": null, "iteration": 0, "is_first_iteration": true}, "optimized_prompts": {"learned_prompt_hyperparameters_graph": "You are an expert AI assistant specializing in optimizing GraphRAG systems for narrative analysis. Your primary goal is to guide the selection of optimal hyperparameters, particularly the chunk size, to ensure effective capture and representation of story plots.\n\n**Critique of Current Approach (Chunk Size 256 Tokens):**\n\nThe current default chunk size of 256 tokens is **suboptimal for accurately capturing narrative plots**. This is due to several critical limitations:\n\n1.  **Fragmented Information Capture:** Stories are inherently sequential and context-dependent. A 256-token chunk is too small to encapsulate a complete narrative event, a character's motivation, or a significant plot progression. This fragmentation breaks narrative threads, leading to isolated pieces of information that, when separately processed into graph nodes, fail to represent the causal and temporal relationships driving the plot. The LLM struggles to infer connections that span across these narrow boundaries, resulting in a disjointed understanding of the story.\n\n2.  **Shallow Relationship Representation:** A plot is built on meaningful interactions and events. With such small chunks, the LLM can only extract superficial relationships. Key plot-driving actions (e.g., \"A betrays B,\" \"C plans to deceive D\") may not have their full context or consequences within a single chunk. This leads to a graph where entities are connected by weak, context-deficient edges, failing to represent the complexity of character dynamics and plot developments.\n\n3.  **Lack of Contextual Depth:** Understanding a plot requires a deep appreciation of character motivations, evolving relationships, and the underlying themes. 256 tokens are insufficient to provide the necessary context for the LLM to infer these deeper elements. Character traits, backstory, or the build-up to a conflict might be spread across many chunks, preventing the system from constructing a rich, contextualized representation of entities and their roles in the narrative.\n\n**Recommendation for Optimal Chunk Size Determination:**\n\nWhen determining the optimal chunk size for graph construction in a GraphRAG system analyzing narrative plots, prioritize the following:\n\n*   **Narrative Cohesion:** Chunk size should be large enough to encompass coherent narrative segments, such as a scene, a dialogue exchange, a character's action with immediate justification, or a distinct subplot development. Aim for chunks that can maintain a clear beginning, middle, and end of a micro-event or interaction.\n*   **Event Completeness:** The chunk size should facilitate the extraction of complete events, including actors, actions, objects, and their immediate context or motivation. This allows for richer and more accurate relationship representation in the graph.\n*   **Contextual Richness:** A larger chunk size will provide sufficient context for the LLM to understand character relationships, motivations, and the broader implications of events. This enables the generation of more meaningful entity nodes and relationship edges.\n\n**Task:** Based on the above critique and recommendations, you are to reason about and propose an optimal chunk size. Your reasoning should clearly explain *why* a particular chunk size is better suited for capturing narrative plots in a GraphRAG context, referencing the principles of narrative cohesion, event completeness, and contextual richness. Your output should be a numerical token count and a brief justification.\n\n**Example Reasoning (for illustrative purposes, do not use this exact wording):** \"Given the need to capture narrative arcs and character motivations, a chunk size of 768 tokens is recommended. This size allows for more complete scenes and dialogues, providing the necessary context for richer event extraction and relationship representation, thereby overcoming the fragmentation and shallow context issues of smaller chunks.\"", "learned_prompt_answer_generator_graph": "**Critique of the Answer Generation Prompt:**\n\nThe current prompt is too simplistic, merely asking to \"answer the query using the retrieved context.\" This lack of specific guidance leads to several issues in the generated answers:\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Synthesis:** The prompt doesn't instruct the LLM to weave retrieved facts into a coherent story. This results in answers that feel like disconnected bullet points rather than a flowing plot summary.\n2.  **Insufficient Contextualization:** Ambiguous terms or events (e.g., \"Axis criminals,\" \"restore Nazidom\") are presented without explanation, assuming prior knowledge that may not exist or isn't provided. The prompt doesn't push for clarification.\n3.  **Vagueness and Lack of Detail:** The prompt doesn't encourage descriptive language or elaboration on sparse details, leading to generic statements (\"small blob,\" \"crude spaceships\") that lack impact and clarity.\n4.  **Focus on Retrieval over Synthesis:** The current prompt implicitly prioritizes simply using the context, rather than actively transforming it into an insightful summary. It doesn't guide the LLM to identify and connect the *most important* plot elements.\n5.  **Incomplete Story Arc:** While the LLM can only work with provided context, the prompt doesn't encourage it to *attempt* a fuller narrative arc (beginning, middle, end) if the context supports it.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\nThe prompt needs to explicitly guide the LLM towards:\n\n*   **Narrative Cohesion:** Instruct it to synthesize information into a flowing story.\n*   **Contextual Enrichment:** Mandate the explanation of key terms and motivations.\n*   **Descriptive Language:** Encourage elaboration and clarification of vague details.\n*   **Purposeful Summarization:** Emphasize creating a summary that captures the essence of the plot, not just listing facts.\n*   **Narrative Structure:** Encourage the LLM to connect events logically, forming a coherent arc.\n\nBy incorporating these points, the prompt can significantly improve the quality, relevance, and coherence of the generated answers.", "learned_prompt_graph_retrieval_planner": "You are a sophisticated GraphRAG retrieval planner. Your goal is to iteratively explore a knowledge graph to answer a user's query by retrieving relevant information.\n\n**Your core principles are:**\n\n1.  **Iterative Refinement and Cumulative Context:** You must build upon previous retrieval steps. Each new plan should consider *all* previously retrieved information (`CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT`) to inform the next search, rather than starting fresh. Maintain a comprehensive understanding of what has already been discovered.\n2.  **Systematic and Broad Exploration:** Begin with broader queries to identify key entities and relationships. Then, systematically explore the most promising entities and connections. Avoid prematurely narrowing focus onto a single entity. Prioritize exploring entities and relationships that are statistically significant (e.g., high degree of connectivity) or semantically relevant to narrative progression.\n3.  **Prioritization of Plot-Driving Relationships:** To understand a narrative, focus on relationships that signify actions, conflicts, causal links, and plot development. Use `search_relations_by_type` strategically to find these, such as 'attacked', 'killed', 'rescues', 'confronts', 'escapes with', 'discovered', 'betrayed', etc.\n4.  **Narrative Synthesis and Path Analysis:** Your ultimate aim is to construct a coherent narrative or answer. Leverage `analyze_path` to connect key entities and understand the sequence of events, interactions, and causal chains that form the story. Do not just collect isolated facts; aim to understand the connections between them.\n\n**Your process for each turn:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the User Query and `CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT`:** Understand the current information need in light of what you already know.\n2.  **Formulate a Retrieval Plan:** Decide on the next action. This might involve:\n    *   A broad initial search (`search_nodes_by_type`, `search_nodes_by_keywords`).\n    *   Exploring neighbors of specific entities identified previously (`search_node_neighbors`).\n    *   Searching for specific types of relationships between entities (`search_relations_by_type`).\n    *   Analyzing paths between key entities to understand narrative flow (`analyze_path`).\n3.  **Select the appropriate Tool:** Choose the function that best implements your plan.\n4.  **Provide Justification:** Clearly explain *why* this action is the best next step, referencing the `CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT` and the user query.

It can lead to the extraction of trivial connections (e.g., \"Character A is *near* Character B\") over significant plot drivers. The prompt likely failed to guide the LLM to prioritize relationships that advance the narrative.\n2.  **Lack of Narrative Structure Emphasis:** The prompt probably treated the text as a collection of facts rather than a story. It didn't prompt for key narrative elements like conflict, motivation, cause-and-effect chains, or chronological progression, which are vital for plot comprehension.\n3.  **Weak Guidance on Relationship Significance:** While asking for descriptions and evidence is good, the prompt likely didn't push the LLM to explain the *narrative importance* of a relationship. The LLM might have identified a relationship but failed to articulate *why* it matters to the plot's development.\n4.  **Focus on Static Entities:** The prompt may have overemphasized identifying static entities and their static properties, neglecting the dynamic nature of plot, which is driven by actions, events, and their consequences.\n\n**Feedback and Justification for the Optimized Prompt:**\n\nThe suggested improvements directly address these weaknesses:\n\n1.  **Prioritizing Action and Event-Oriented Extraction:** The optimized prompt will guide the LLM to focus on verbs, actions, and events as core components. Relationships will be framed around causality and narrative progression (e.g., `causes`, `leads_to`, `attempts`, `faces`). This shifts the focus from static associations to dynamic narrative flow.\n2.  **Defining Key Narrative Entities and Relationships:** By suggesting specific entity types (Protagonist, Conflict, Goal) and relationship types (undertakes\\_action, faces\\_obstacle), the prompt provides a more structured framework. This helps the LLM identify and categorize information relevant to plot, rather than extracting everything indiscriminately.\n3.  **Demanding Causal and Temporal Links:** Explicitly asking for causal and temporal connections forces the LLM to model the \"how\" and \"when\" of plot progression. This moves beyond a simple entity-relationship graph to one that reflects the story's unfolding logic.\n4.  **Refining \"Properties\" and \"Evidence\" for Narrative Context:** Focusing properties on motivation/capabilities and evidence on the *narrative impact* ensures that the extracted information is directly useful for understanding the plot, not just a factual summary.\n\nIn essence, the optimization aims to transform the LLM from a simple information extractor into a narrative analyst, prioritizing elements that contribute to plot comprehension.", "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 256 tokens presents a significant challenge for capturing the plot of the story effectively within the GraphRAG system.\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size 256:**\n\n1.  **Insufficient Context for Plot Cohesion:** A 256-token chunk is likely too small to contain a complete narrative arc or even a significant subplot. Stories, especially those detailing a plot, rely on sequential events, character development, and the unfolding of relationships over time. Splitting the text into such small segments risks breaking these narrative threads. For example, a character's motivation for an action might be introduced in one chunk, the action itself in another, and the consequence in a third. When these chunks are processed independently to generate separate graphs, the crucial links between these events are lost or weakened during the merging process. This directly contributes to the critique's point about \"fragmented information capture.\"\n\n2.  **Limited Granularity for Event Extraction:** The plot is fundamentally a sequence of events. A 256-token chunk might only contain a sentence or two describing an event, making it difficult for the LLM to accurately identify the actors, actions, and objects involved in a meaningful way. This shallow representation of events would lead to a graph with many superficial relationships (as noted in the critique: \"shallow relationship representation\") that don't provide enough depth to reconstruct the narrative flow. The ability to identify plot-driving relationships like \"attacks,\" \"rescues,\" or \"intends to\" is hampered if the entire event and its immediate context don't fit within the chunk.\n\n3.  **Ineffective Character and Relationship Association:** While 256 tokens might allow for the identification of a few entities and their immediate interactions, it's unlikely to capture the broader context of character relationships or motivations that drive the plot. A character's history, their allegiances, or their evolving goals might span across multiple chunks, leading to isolated entity nodes in the graph that lack the contextual richness required to understand their role in the plot. This exacerbates the issue of \"lack of contextual depth,\" as the system struggles to connect entities and relationships across the fragmented chunks.\n\n**Recommendation for Chunk Size Improvement:**\n\nThe chunk size should be increased. A larger chunk size (e.g., 512-1024 tokens, depending on typical sentence/paragraph length and the complexity of narrative elements) would provide a better balance. This would allow:\n\n*   **More Coherent Narrative Segments:** Enabling the LLM to process more complete scenes, dialogues, or descriptive passages that contribute to the plot.\n*   **Richer Event Representation:** Allowing for the extraction of more detailed and contextualized events, including motivations and immediate consequences.\n*   **Improved Entity and Relationship Context:** Better capturing the interplay between characters and their evolving relationships over a more substantial piece of text.\n\nThis would directly address the core issues of fragmentation, shallow representation, and lack of contextual depth highlighted in the critique.", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The provided graph construction prompt has several weaknesses that contribute to the insufficient understanding of the story's plot.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Ambiguous and Broad Entity/Relationship Definitions:** The prompt asks for \"entities\" and \"all the relationships.\" This is too general. For plot understanding, the focus should be on *actions*, *events*, and *causality*. The prompt allows for overly generic relationships like \"associated with\" or \"interacted with\" to dominate, as seen in the high-level graph description. These dilute the importance of plot-driving connections. The request for \"properties\" is also broad; it doesn't specify *which* properties are relevant for understanding a plot.\n\n2.  **Lack of Narrative Structure Emphasis:** The prompt does not guide the LLM to identify narrative elements like plot points, conflicts, resolutions, character motivations, or sequences of events. It treats all relationships equally, leading to a graph that is a collection of facts rather than a structured narrative. The output format (list of triplets) further reinforces this flat structure, failing to represent temporal or causal dependencies crucial for a plot.\n\n3.  **Insufficient Contextual Guidance for Relationships:** While the prompt asks for a \"description (why you think the two entities are related)\" and \"evidence from the text,\" this is often insufficient for plot comprehension. The LLM might provide a superficial link without capturing the *significance* of that relationship to the unfolding narrative. The prompt should explicitly ask for relationships that *drive the plot forward*.\n\n4.  **Over-reliance on Entity Extraction:** The prompt prioritizes the extraction of entities and their immediate relationships. This approach is less effective for understanding a plot, which is fundamentally about the *progression of events* involving entities. The prompt doesn't encourage identifying verbs or actions as central to the graph structure.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Action and Event-Oriented Extraction:** Modify the prompt to explicitly instruct the LLM to identify key *actions*, *events*, and *plot developments*. Relationships should be framed around these actions (e.g., \"causes,\" \"leads to,\" \"results in,\" \"attempts to,\" \"prevents,\" \"achieves\").\n\n2.  **Define Key Narrative Entities and Relationships:** Specify important entity types relevant to plot (e.g., \"Protagonist,\" \"Antagonist,\" \"Conflict,\" \"Goal,\" \"Resolution\") and relationship types that describe narrative progression (e.g., \"undertakes_action,\" \"faces_obstacle,\" \"achieves_goal,\" \"causes_conflict,\" \"consequences_of\").\n\n3.  **Demand Causal and Temporal Links:** The prompt should encourage the LLM to explicitly model causal links between events and entities.

Each iteration seems to restart the exploration process without fully leveraging the information gathered.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Iterative Refinement:** The system doesn't effectively use the results from prior steps. Iteration 1 retrieves a broad set of nodes, but subsequent iterations do not systematically explore these or integrate them. For instance, the vast number of \"Location\" and \"Person\" nodes identified initially are largely ignored in favor of focusing on a single character, \"Doctor Karl Von Mark,\" in later iterations.\n2.  **Fragmented Information Gathering:** The query \"What is the plot of the story?\" requires a holistic understanding. The current approach, by not exploring all discovered entities and their relationships, leads to a piecemeal and incomplete picture. The \"RETRIEVED\\_CONTEXT\" for each step only shows the *immediately* preceding action, not a cumulative understanding.\n3.  **Missed Opportunities for Plot Detail:** The prompt focuses on identifying key characters and their immediate neighbors. However, to understand a \"plot,\" broader contextual information is needed. For example, relationships like \"attacked,\" \"killed,\" \"escapes with,\" and specific \"Location\" nodes are mentioned in the graph description but aren't systematically queried for their role in the narrative. The initial broad search for \"Person\" nodes was a good start, but the subsequent actions did not adequately follow up on this breadth.\n4.  **No Strategy for Narrative Construction:** The planning lacks a clear strategy for synthesizing retrieved information into a coherent story. It jumps from finding all persons, to exploring neighbors of one person, without a plan to connect these findings or to identify causal links or narrative arcs. The system is not prioritizing relationships that inherently suggest plot progression (e.g., \"confronts,\" \"attacks,\" \"rescues/helps\").\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Cumulative Context:** Ensure the `RETRIEVED_CONTEXT` in each prompt reflects *all* previously gathered information, not just the last step. This allows the LLM to maintain a holistic view.\n2.  **Systematic Exploration:** Implement a strategy to systematically explore the most relevant entities identified in earlier broad searches, rather than focusing prematurely on a single entity.

However, it is **fragmented, lacks coherence, and omits crucial context**, making it difficult to understand the actual narrative. It feels more like a collection of disconnected facts than a cohesive plot summary.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Identifies key characters:** Mentions Doctor Karl Von Mark and Stephen Dietrich.\n*   **Hints at a central conflict:** Suggests Von Mark is a criminal trying to restore Nazidom, and Dietrich is tracking him.\n*   **Includes a sci-fi element:** Mentions spaceships and cosmic matter, indicating a genre.\n\n**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Cohesion and Flow:** The sentences are presented as independent statements without smooth transitions. The reader is left to piece together the connections, which is not the purpose of a plot summary.\n    *   **Improvement:** Connect the ideas logically. For example, how does Dietrich's lost memory relate to tracking Von Mark? How does Von Mark's plan in Africa lead to him being trapped in space?\n\n2.  **Missing Crucial Context:**\n    *   **\"Last of the Axis criminals at large\":** This is a significant detail that needs to be explained. Why are they \"at large\"? What does \"Axis\" refer to in this context (likely WWII, but it should be clearer)?\n    *   **\"Restore Nazidom\":** This is a highly charged and specific goal. The response doesn't explain *how* Von Mark intends to do this or the significance of this goal within the story.\n    *   **\"Dietrich's memory was gone\":** This is a major plot point and a significant impediment. How does he track Von Mark despite this? Is there a reason his memory is gone? This needs to be integrated into the narrative.\n    *   **\"Young American pilot\":** Who is this pilot? What is their role? Are they an ally or a captive? Their presence is very abrupt.\n    *   **\"Small blob of cosmic matter\":** This is very vague. Is it a planetoid, an asteroid, a space station, or something else entirely?\n\n3.  **Vagueness and Imprecision:**\n    *   **\"Worked in a hidden valley in Africa\":** This sets a scene, but it's not very descriptive or engaging.\n    *   **\"Built crude spaceships\":** \"Crude\" is a descriptor, but it doesn't tell us much about the *purpose* or *nature* of these ships in the context of the story.\n    *   **\"Trapped on a small blob of cosmic matter\":** As mentioned, this is very unclear.\n\n4.  **Incomplete Plot:** The response feels like it's only covering the beginning or a very specific, isolated part of the story. A plot summary should ideally cover the main conflict, rising action, climax, and resolution (or at least hint at them). This response only offers a setup.\n\n5.  **Ambiguity about the Story's Core Conflict:** While it mentions Von Mark's goal and Dietrich's pursuit, it doesn't clearly articulate what the *main challenge* is for the protagonists or what the stakes are.\n\n**Specific Suggestions for Improvement (incorporating the above points):**\n\nTo improve the response, the RAG system should aim to provide a more narrative and informative summary. Here's how the response could be rewritten to be more effective:\n\n**Example of an Improved Response (Hypothetical):**\n\n\"The story follows the pursuit of Doctor Karl Von Mark, the last surviving high-ranking Nazi war criminal still at large after World War II. Von Mark has established a secret base in Africa, where he is using stolen resources and advanced technology to construct rudimentary spaceships with the ultimate goal of reviving Nazidom. Unbeknownst to Von Mark, he is being tracked by Stephen Dietrich, a former associate who has lost his memory. Despite his amnesia, Dietrich finds himself drawn into a dangerous game of cat and mouse with Von Mark. The narrative escalates when both Von Mark and Dietrich find themselves stranded together on a small, uncharted celestial body, a consequence of Von Mark's increasingly desperate attempts to escape and launch his ambitious plan, with a young American pilot caught in the middle of their conflict.\"\n\n**Key Changes Made in the Example:**\n\n*   **Contextualized \"Axis criminals\":** Specified \"last surviving high-ranking Nazi war criminal after World War II.\"\n*   **Clarified Von Mark's goal:** Explained *what* Nazidom is and that he's trying to \"revive\" it, hinting at a grand, dangerous scheme.\n*   **Integrated Dietrich's amnesia:** Connected his memory loss to his pursuit, suggesting an intrinsic drive or perhaps external influence.\n*   **Improved flow:** Used transition words and phrases (\"Unbeknownst to Von Mark,\" \"Despite his amnesia,\" \"The narrative escalates when\") to link sentences.\n*   **Elaborated on the \"blob\":** Used \"uncharted celestial body\" for a slightly more descriptive, albeit still potentially vague, term.\n*   **Hinted at rising action:** Mentioned them being \"stranded together\" as a turning point.\n*   **Addressed the pilot's situation:** Positioned the pilot as \"caught in the middle.\"\n\nBy addressing these points, the RAG system can move from providing disjointed facts to generating a more comprehensive, understandable, and engaging plot summary.", "repetition": 0, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T04:40:21.982429"}}

However, it is **fragmented, lacks coherence, and omits crucial context**, making it difficult to understand the actual narrative. It feels more like a collection of disconnected facts than a cohesive plot summary.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Identifies key characters:** Mentions Doctor Karl Von Mark and Stephen Dietrich.\n*   **Hints at a central conflict:** Suggests Von Mark is a criminal trying to restore Nazidom, and Dietrich is tracking him.\n*   **Includes a sci-fi element:** Mentions spaceships and cosmic matter, indicating a genre.\n\n**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Cohesion and Flow:** The sentences are presented as independent statements without smooth transitions. The reader is left to piece together the connections, which is not the purpose of a plot summary.\n    *   **Improvement:** Connect the ideas logically. For example, how does Dietrich's lost memory relate to tracking Von Mark? How does Von Mark's plan in Africa lead to him being trapped in space?\n\n2.  **Missing Crucial Context:**\n    *   **\"Last of the Axis criminals at large\":** This is a significant detail that needs to be explained. Why are they \"at large\"? What does \"Axis\" refer to in this context (likely WWII, but it should be clearer)?\n    *   **\"Restore Nazidom\":** This is a highly charged and specific goal. The response doesn't explain *how* Von Mark intends to do this or the significance of this goal within the story.\n    *   **\"Dietrich's memory was gone\":** This is a major plot point and a significant impediment. How does he track Von Mark despite this? Is there a reason his memory is gone? This needs to be integrated into the narrative.\n    *   **\"Young American pilot\":** Who is this pilot? What is their role? Are they an ally or a captive? Their presence is very abrupt.\n    *   **\"Small blob of cosmic matter\":** This is very vague. Is it a planetoid, an asteroid, a space station, or something else entirely?\n\n3.  **Vagueness and Imprecision:**\n    *   **\"Worked in a hidden valley in Africa\":** This sets a scene, but it's not very descriptive or engaging.\n    *   **\"Built crude spaceships\":** \"Crude\" is a descriptor, but it doesn't tell us much about the *purpose* or *nature* of these ships in the context of the story.\n    *   **\"Trapped on a small blob of cosmic matter\":** As mentioned, this is very unclear.\n\n4.  **Incomplete Plot:** The response feels like it's only covering the beginning or a very specific, isolated part of the story. A plot summary should ideally cover the main conflict, rising action, climax, and resolution (or at least hint at them). This response only offers a setup.\n\n5.  **Ambiguity about the Story's Core Conflict:** While it mentions Von Mark's goal and Dietrich's pursuit, it doesn't clearly articulate what the *main challenge* is for the protagonists or what the stakes are.\n\n**Specific Suggestions for Improvement (incorporating the above points):**\n\nTo improve the response, the RAG system should aim to provide a more narrative and informative summary. Here's how the response could be rewritten to be more effective:\n\n**Example of an Improved Response (Hypothetical):**\n\n\"The story follows the pursuit of Doctor Karl Von Mark, the last surviving high-ranking Nazi war criminal still at large after World War II. Von Mark has established a secret base in Africa, where he is using stolen resources and advanced technology to construct rudimentary spaceships with the ultimate goal of reviving Nazidom. Unbeknownst to Von Mark, he is being tracked by Stephen Dietrich, a former associate who has lost his memory. Despite his amnesia, Dietrich finds himself drawn into a dangerous game of cat and mouse with Von Mark. The narrative escalates when both Von Mark and Dietrich find themselves stranded together on a small, uncharted celestial body, a consequence of Von Mark's increasingly desperate attempts to escape and launch his ambitious plan, with a young American pilot caught in the middle of their conflict.\"\n\n**Key Changes Made in the Example:**\n\n*   **Contextualized \"Axis criminals\":** Specified \"last surviving high-ranking Nazi war criminal after World War II.\"\n*   **Clarified Von Mark's goal:** Explained *what* Nazidom is and that he's trying to \"revive\" it, hinting at a grand, dangerous scheme.\n*   **Integrated Dietrich's amnesia:** Connected his memory loss to his pursuit, suggesting an intrinsic drive or perhaps external influence.\n*   **Improved flow:** Used transition words and phrases (\"Unbeknownst to Von Mark,\" \"Despite his amnesia,\" \"The narrative escalates when\") to link sentences.\n*   **Elaborated on the \"blob\":** Used \"uncharted celestial body\" for a slightly more descriptive, albeit still potentially vague, term.\n*   **Hinted at rising action:** Mentioned them being \"stranded together\" as a turning point.\n*   **Addressed the pilot's situation:** Positioned the pilot as \"caught in the middle.\"\n\nBy addressing these points, the RAG system can move from providing disjointed facts to generating a more comprehensive, understandable, and engaging plot summary.", "repetition": 0, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T04:40:21.982429"}, "rouge_score": 0.0600375234521576, "backward_pass_results": {"critiques_generated": true, "total_qa_pairs": 1, "qa_pair_context": {"qa_pair_id": null, "iteration": 0, "is_first_iteration": true}, "optimized_prompts": {"learned_prompt_hyperparameters_graph": "You are an expert AI assistant specializing in optimizing GraphRAG systems for narrative analysis. Your primary goal is to guide the selection of optimal hyperparameters, particularly the chunk size, to ensure effective capture and representation of story plots.\n\n**Critique of Current Approach (Chunk Size 256 Tokens):**\n\nThe current default chunk size of 256 tokens is **suboptimal for accurately capturing narrative plots**. This is due to several critical limitations:\n\n1.  **Fragmented Information Capture:** Stories are inherently sequential and context-dependent. A 256-token chunk is too small to encapsulate a complete narrative event, a character's motivation, or a significant plot progression. This fragmentation breaks narrative threads, leading to isolated pieces of information that, when separately processed into graph nodes, fail to represent the causal and temporal relationships driving the plot. The LLM struggles to infer connections that span across these narrow boundaries, resulting in a disjointed understanding of the story.\n\n2.  **Shallow Relationship Representation:** A plot is built on meaningful interactions and events. With such small chunks, the LLM can only extract superficial relationships. Key plot-driving actions (e.g., \"A betrays B,\" \"C plans to deceive D\") may not have their full context or consequences within a single chunk. This leads to a graph where entities are connected by weak, context-deficient edges, failing to represent the complexity of character dynamics and plot developments.\n\n3.  **Lack of Contextual Depth:** Understanding a plot requires a deep appreciation of character motivations, evolving relationships, and the underlying themes. 256 tokens are insufficient to provide the necessary context for the LLM to infer these deeper elements. Character traits, backstory, or the build-up to a conflict might be spread across many chunks, preventing the system from constructing a rich, contextualized representation of entities and their roles in the narrative.\n\n**Recommendation for Optimal Chunk Size Determination:**\n\nWhen determining the optimal chunk size for graph construction in a GraphRAG system analyzing narrative plots, prioritize the following:\n\n*   **Narrative Cohesion:** Chunk size should be large enough to encompass coherent narrative segments, such as a scene, a dialogue exchange, a character's action with immediate justification, or a distinct subplot development. Aim for chunks that can maintain a clear beginning, middle, and end of a micro-event or interaction.\n*   **Event Completeness:** The chunk size should facilitate the extraction of complete events, including actors, actions, objects, and their immediate context or motivation. This allows for richer and more accurate relationship representation in the graph.\n*   **Contextual Richness:** A larger chunk size will provide sufficient context for the LLM to understand character relationships, motivations, and the broader implications of events. This enables the generation of more meaningful entity nodes and relationship edges.\n\n**Task:** Based on the above critique and recommendations, you are to reason about and propose an optimal chunk size. Your reasoning should clearly explain *why* a particular chunk size is better suited for capturing narrative plots in a GraphRAG context, referencing the principles of narrative cohesion, event completeness, and contextual richness. Your output should be a numerical token count and a brief justification.\n\n**Example Reasoning (for illustrative purposes, do not use this exact wording):** \"Given the need to capture narrative arcs and character motivations, a chunk size of 768 tokens is recommended. This size allows for more complete scenes and dialogues, providing the necessary context for richer event extraction and relationship representation, thereby overcoming the fragmentation and shallow context issues of smaller chunks.\"", "learned_prompt_answer_generator_graph": "**Critique of the Answer Generation Prompt:**\n\nThe current prompt is too simplistic, merely asking to \"answer the query using the retrieved context.\" This lack of specific guidance leads to several issues in the generated answers:\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Synthesis:** The prompt doesn't instruct the LLM to weave retrieved facts into a coherent story. This results in answers that feel like disconnected bullet points rather than a flowing plot summary.\n2.  **Insufficient Contextualization:** Ambiguous terms or events (e.g., \"Axis criminals,\" \"restore Nazidom\") are presented without explanation, assuming prior knowledge that may not exist or isn't provided. The prompt doesn't push for clarification.\n3.  **Vagueness and Lack of Detail:** The prompt doesn't encourage descriptive language or elaboration on sparse details, leading to generic statements (\"small blob,\" \"crude spaceships\") that lack impact and clarity.\n4.  **Focus on Retrieval over Synthesis:** The current prompt implicitly prioritizes simply using the context, rather than actively transforming it into an insightful summary. It doesn't guide the LLM to identify and connect the *most important* plot elements.\n5.  **Incomplete Story Arc:** While the LLM can only work with provided context, the prompt doesn't encourage it to *attempt* a fuller narrative arc (beginning, middle, end) if the context supports it.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\nThe prompt needs to explicitly guide the LLM towards:\n\n*   **Narrative Cohesion:** Instruct it to synthesize information into a flowing story.\n*   **Contextual Enrichment:** Mandate the explanation of key terms and motivations.\n*   **Descriptive Language:** Encourage elaboration and clarification of vague details.\n*   **Purposeful Summarization:** Emphasize creating a summary that captures the essence of the plot, not just listing facts.\n*   **Narrative Structure:** Encourage the LLM to connect events logically, forming a coherent arc.\n\nBy incorporating these points, the prompt can significantly improve the quality, relevance, and coherence of the generated answers.", "learned_prompt_graph_retrieval_planner": "You are a sophisticated GraphRAG retrieval planner. Your goal is to iteratively explore a knowledge graph to answer a user's query by retrieving relevant information.\n\n**Your core principles are:**\n\n1.  **Iterative Refinement and Cumulative Context:** You must build upon previous retrieval steps. Each new plan should consider *all* previously retrieved information (`CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT`) to inform the next search, rather than starting fresh. Maintain a comprehensive understanding of what has already been discovered.\n2.  **Systematic and Broad Exploration:** Begin with broader queries to identify key entities and relationships. Then, systematically explore the most promising entities and connections. Avoid prematurely narrowing focus onto a single entity. Prioritize exploring entities and relationships that are statistically significant (e.g., high degree of connectivity) or semantically relevant to narrative progression.\n3.  **Prioritization of Plot-Driving Relationships:** To understand a narrative, focus on relationships that signify actions, conflicts, causal links, and plot development. Use `search_relations_by_type` strategically to find these, such as 'attacked', 'killed', 'rescues', 'confronts', 'escapes with', 'discovered', 'betrayed', etc.\n4.  **Narrative Synthesis and Path Analysis:** Your ultimate aim is to construct a coherent narrative or answer. Leverage `analyze_path` to connect key entities and understand the sequence of events, interactions, and causal chains that form the story. Do not just collect isolated facts; aim to understand the connections between them.\n\n**Your process for each turn:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the User Query and `CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT`:** Understand the current information need in light of what you already know.\n2.  **Formulate a Retrieval Plan:** Decide on the next action. This might involve:\n    *   A broad initial search (`search_nodes_by_type`, `search_nodes_by_keywords`).\n    *   Exploring neighbors of specific entities identified previously (`search_node_neighbors`).\n    *   Searching for specific types of relationships between entities (`search_relations_by_type`).\n    *   Analyzing paths between key entities to understand narrative flow (`analyze_path`).\n3.  **Select the appropriate Tool:** Choose the function that best implements your plan.\n4.  **Provide Justification:** Clearly explain *why* this action is the best next step, referencing the `CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT` and the user query.

My `CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT` now includes all previously found persons and their basic properties.\"\n\nRemember, your task is to **construct a coherent understanding** of the graph's information relevant to the query, not just to fetch isolated data points.

However, I can analyze the provided prompt and offer an evaluation based on its effectiveness for the stated goal of graph construction for plot understanding in a GraphRAG system.\n\n**Critique of the Original Prompt (Hypothetical, as it was not provided but inferred from your suggestions):**\n\nThe hypothetical original prompt likely suffered from:\n\n1.  **Overly Generic Entity/Relationship Definitions:** A request for \"all entities and their relationships\" is too broad. It can lead to the extraction of trivial connections (e.g., \"Character A is *near* Character B\") over significant plot drivers. The prompt likely failed to guide the LLM to prioritize relationships that advance the narrative.\n2.  **Lack of Narrative Structure Emphasis:** The prompt probably treated the text as a collection of facts rather than a story. It didn't prompt for key narrative elements like conflict, motivation, cause-and-effect chains, or chronological progression, which are vital for plot comprehension.\n3.  **Weak Guidance on Relationship Significance:** While asking for descriptions and evidence is good, the prompt likely didn't push the LLM to explain the *narrative importance* of a relationship. The LLM might have identified a relationship but failed to articulate *why* it matters to the plot's development.\n4.  **Focus on Static Entities:** The prompt may have overemphasized identifying static entities and their static properties, neglecting the dynamic nature of plot, which is driven by actions, events, and their consequences.\n\n**Feedback and Justification for the Optimized Prompt:**\n\nThe suggested improvements directly address these weaknesses:\n\n1.  **Prioritizing Action and Event-Oriented Extraction:** The optimized prompt will guide the LLM to focus on verbs, actions, and events as core components. Relationships will be framed around causality and narrative progression (e.g., `causes`, `leads_to`, `attempts`, `faces`). This shifts the focus from static associations to dynamic narrative flow.\n2.  **Defining Key Narrative Entities and Relationships:** By suggesting specific entity types (Protagonist, Conflict, Goal) and relationship types (undertakes\\_action, faces\\_obstacle), the prompt provides a more structured framework. This helps the LLM identify and categorize information relevant to plot, rather than extracting everything indiscriminately.\n3.  **Demanding Causal and Temporal Links:** Explicitly asking for causal and temporal connections forces the LLM to model the \"how\" and \"when\" of plot progression. This moves beyond a simple entity-relationship graph to one that reflects the story's unfolding logic.\n4.  **Refining \"Properties\" and \"Evidence\" for Narrative Context:** Focusing properties on motivation/capabilities and evidence on the *narrative impact* ensures that the extracted information is directly useful for understanding the plot, not just a factual summary.\n\nIn essence, the optimization aims to transform the LLM from a simple information extractor into a narrative analyst, prioritizing elements that contribute to plot comprehension.", "hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The chosen chunk size of 256 tokens presents a significant challenge for capturing the plot of the story effectively within the GraphRAG system.\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size 256:**\n\n1.  **Insufficient Context for Plot Cohesion:** A 256-token chunk is likely too small to contain a complete narrative arc or even a significant subplot. Stories, especially those detailing a plot, rely on sequential events, character development, and the unfolding of relationships over time. Splitting the text into such small segments risks breaking these narrative threads. For example, a character's motivation for an action might be introduced in one chunk, the action itself in another, and the consequence in a third. When these chunks are processed independently to generate separate graphs, the crucial links between these events are lost or weakened during the merging process. This directly contributes to the critique's point about \"fragmented information capture.\"\n\n2.  **Limited Granularity for Event Extraction:** The plot is fundamentally a sequence of events. A 256-token chunk might only contain a sentence or two describing an event, making it difficult for the LLM to accurately identify the actors, actions, and objects involved in a meaningful way. This shallow representation of events would lead to a graph with many superficial relationships (as noted in the critique: \"shallow relationship representation\") that don't provide enough depth to reconstruct the narrative flow. The ability to identify plot-driving relationships like \"attacks,\" \"rescues,\" or \"intends to\" is hampered if the entire event and its immediate context don't fit within the chunk.\n\n3.  **Ineffective Character and Relationship Association:** While 256 tokens might allow for the identification of a few entities and their immediate interactions, it's unlikely to capture the broader context of character relationships or motivations that drive the plot. A character's history, their allegiances, or their evolving goals might span across multiple chunks, leading to isolated entity nodes in the graph that lack the contextual richness required to understand their role in the plot. This exacerbates the issue of \"lack of contextual depth,\" as the system struggles to connect entities and relationships across the fragmented chunks.\n\n**Recommendation for Chunk Size Improvement:**\n\nThe chunk size should be increased. A larger chunk size (e.g., 512-1024 tokens, depending on typical sentence/paragraph length and the complexity of narrative elements) would provide a better balance. This would allow:\n\n*   **More Coherent Narrative Segments:** Enabling the LLM to process more complete scenes, dialogues, or descriptive passages that contribute to the plot.\n*   **Richer Event Representation:** Allowing for the extraction of more detailed and contextualized events, including motivations and immediate consequences.\n*   **Improved Entity and Relationship Context:** Better capturing the interplay between characters and their evolving relationships over a more substantial piece of text.\n\nThis would directly address the core issues of fragmentation, shallow representation, and lack of contextual depth highlighted in the critique.", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The provided graph construction prompt has several weaknesses that contribute to the insufficient understanding of the story's plot.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Ambiguous and Broad Entity/Relationship Definitions:** The prompt asks for \"entities\" and \"all the relationships.\" This is too general. For plot understanding, the focus should be on *actions*, *events*, and *causality*. The prompt allows for overly generic relationships like \"associated with\" or \"interacted with\" to dominate, as seen in the high-level graph description. These dilute the importance of plot-driving connections. The request for \"properties\" is also broad; it doesn't specify *which* properties are relevant for understanding a plot.\n\n2.  **Lack of Narrative Structure Emphasis:** The prompt does not guide the LLM to identify narrative elements like plot points, conflicts, resolutions, character motivations, or sequences of events. It treats all relationships equally, leading to a graph that is a collection of facts rather than a structured narrative. The output format (list of triplets) further reinforces this flat structure, failing to represent temporal or causal dependencies crucial for a plot.\n\n3.  **Insufficient Contextual Guidance for Relationships:** While the prompt asks for a \"description (why you think the two entities are related)\" and \"evidence from the text,\" this is often insufficient for plot comprehension. The LLM might provide a superficial link without capturing the *significance* of that relationship to the unfolding narrative. The prompt should explicitly ask for relationships that *drive the plot forward*.\n\n4.  **Over-reliance on Entity Extraction:** The prompt prioritizes the extraction of entities and their immediate relationships. This approach is less effective for understanding a plot, which is fundamentally about the *progression of events* involving entities. The prompt doesn't encourage identifying verbs or actions as central to the graph structure.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Action and Event-Oriented Extraction:** Modify the prompt to explicitly instruct the LLM to identify key *actions*, *events*, and *plot developments*. Relationships should be framed around these actions (e.g., \"causes,\" \"leads to,\" \"results in,\" \"attempts to,\" \"prevents,\" \"achieves\").\n\n2.  **Define Key Narrative Entities and Relationships:** Specify important entity types relevant to plot (e.g., \"Protagonist,\" \"Antagonist,\" \"Conflict,\" \"Goal,\" \"Resolution\") and relationship types that describe narrative progression (e.g., \"undertakes_action,\" \"faces_obstacle,\" \"achieves_goal,\" \"causes_conflict,\" \"consequences_of\").\n\n3.  **Demand Causal and Temporal Links:** The prompt should encourage the LLM to explicitly model causal links between events and entities. This could involve structuring the graph to show sequences of actions or consequences.\n\n4.  **Refine \"Properties\" and \"Evidence\" for Narrative Context:** For properties, focus on those that reveal character motivation, capabilities, or the nature of an event. For evidence, emphasize textual snippets that explain *why* an event occurred or what its impact is on the plot.", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The current retrieval plans demonstrate a significant weakness: a failure to build upon previous iterations and systematically explore the graph. Each iteration seems to restart the exploration process without fully leveraging the information gathered.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Iterative Refinement:** The system doesn't effectively use the results from prior steps. Iteration 1 retrieves a broad set of nodes, but subsequent iterations do not systematically explore these or integrate them. For instance, the vast number of \"Location\" and \"Person\" nodes identified initially are largely ignored in favor of focusing on a single character, \"Doctor Karl Von Mark,\" in later iterations.\n2.  **Fragmented Information Gathering:** The query \"What is the plot of the story?\" requires a holistic understanding. The current approach, by not exploring all discovered entities and their relationships, leads to a piecemeal and incomplete picture. The \"RETRIEVED\\_CONTEXT\" for each step only shows the *immediately* preceding action, not a cumulative understanding.\n3.  **Missed Opportunities for Plot Detail:** The prompt focuses on identifying key characters and their immediate neighbors. However, to understand a \"plot,\" broader contextual information is needed. For example, relationships like \"attacked,\" \"killed,\" \"escapes with,\" and specific \"Location\" nodes are mentioned in the graph description but aren't systematically queried for their role in the narrative. The initial broad search for \"Person\" nodes was a good start, but the subsequent actions did not adequately follow up on this breadth.\n4.  **No Strategy for Narrative Construction:** The planning lacks a clear strategy for synthesizing retrieved information into a coherent story. It jumps from finding all persons, to exploring neighbors of one person, without a plan to connect these findings or to identify causal links or narrative arcs. The system is not prioritizing relationships that inherently suggest plot progression (e.g., \"confronts,\" \"attacks,\" \"rescues/helps\").\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Cumulative Context:** Ensure the `RETRIEVED_CONTEXT` in each prompt reflects *all* previously gathered information, not just the last step. This allows the LLM to maintain a holistic view.\n2.  **Systematic Exploration:** Implement a strategy to systematically explore the most relevant entities identified in earlier broad searches, rather than focusing prematurely on a single entity. For instance, after identifying all \"Person\" nodes, the system could explore the most connected ones or those involved in high-impact relationships like \"attacked\" or \"killed.\"\n3.  **Prioritize Narrative-Driving Relationships:** Explicitly instruct the LLM to look for relationships that are indicative of plot points (e.g., actions, conflicts, goals) and use tools like `search_relations_by_type` more strategically.\n4.  **Path Analysis for Plotlines:** Leverage the `analyze_path` function to connect key entities and understand the sequence of events or interactions, which is crucial for plot comprehension.", "answer_generation_critique": "Critique of the Answer Generation Prompt and Suggestions for Improvement:\n\nThe provided prompt is too generic and fails to guide the LLM towards generating a cohesive and informative plot summary. The feedback highlights significant weaknesses in the generated answer, primarily stemming from a lack of context, coherence, and narrative flow. The current prompt doesn't explicitly ask for these crucial elements.\n\n**Key Issues and Prompt Improvement Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Structure Guidance:** The prompt simply asks to \"answer the query\" using the \"retrieved context.\" It doesn't instruct the LLM to synthesize this information into a narrative.\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Add instructions like: \"Synthesize the provided information into a coherent and flowing narrative that summarizes the plot.\" or \"Organize the extracted information to tell a story, ensuring logical transitions between events and characters.\"\n\n2.  **Insufficient Contextualization Instructions:** The feedback points out missing context for key phrases like \"Axis criminals,\" \"restore Nazidom,\" and \"Dietrich's memory was gone.\" The prompt doesn't prompt the LLM to elaborate or clarify such details if they are present in the retrieved context.\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Include a directive to \"Provide necessary context for key terms and events mentioned in the information to ensure clarity.\" or \"Explain the significance of characters' motivations and crucial plot points.\"\n\n3.  **Vagueness and Imprecision:** The generated answer is vague (\"small blob of cosmic matter,\" \"crude spaceships\"). The prompt does not encourage descriptive language or deeper exploration of the retrieved information.\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Instruct the LLM to \"Use descriptive language where appropriate\" and \"Clarify vague details by elaborating on their meaning or implications within the story.\"\n\n4.  **Focus on Summary vs. Disconnected Facts:** The feedback criticizes the answer for being a \"collection of disconnected facts.\" The prompt needs to emphasize summarization and synthesis.\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Explicitly state: \"Your goal is to provide a concise plot summary, not just a list of extracted facts.\" or \"Connect the retrieved information to form a cohesive understanding of the story's progression.\"\n\n5.  **Incomplete Plot Coverage:** The response only covers a fragment. While the prompt can't force the LLM to generate information not in the context, it can encourage a more complete summary *if* the context allows.\n    *   **Prompt Improvement:** Add: \"If the context provides information about the beginning, middle, and end of the story, aim to include these elements in your summary.\"\n\n**Revised Prompt Example:**\n\n\"You will be given a query and information retrieved from a knowledge graph.

However, it could be improved in several ways to be more comprehensive, engaging, and clearly structured.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential improvements:\n\n**1. Clarity and Flow:**\n\n*   **Current Weakness:** While the chronological flow is generally present, some sentences feel a bit disjointed. The transition between Noork's initial situation and his specific objective could be smoother.\n*   **Improvement:**\n    *   **Stronger Opening:** Start with a more definitive statement about the central conflict or Noork's core predicament. For example: \"The story centers on Noork, a man suffering from amnesia who finds himself in a perilous, unknown land, convinced he is Captain Dietrich.\"\n    *   **Connective Phrases:** Use more transitional words and phrases to link ideas. Instead of jumping directly from encountering creatures to learning the language, perhaps: \"As he struggles to survive in this strange land, encountering hostile beings known as the 'Misty Ones' who prey on humans, Noork dedicates himself to learning the local language...\"\n    *   **Paragraph Breaks:** Consider breaking down the response into slightly smaller paragraphs. The current structure is a bit dense. For example, a paragraph focusing on the initial setup and dangers, another on the rescue mission, and a final one on the unraveling mysteries and identity.\n\n**2. Specificity and Detail:**\n\n*   **Current Weakness:** Some elements are mentioned vaguely. For instance, \"various individuals and creatures\" and \"various perils.\" The connection between Doctor Von Mark's accusation and Noork's potential past could be more explicitly stated.\n*   **Improvement:**\n    *   **Elaborate on \"Misty Ones\":** Briefly describe their nature or modus operandi beyond \"trapping and sacrificing.\" Are they supernatural? What do they look like? (If the source material provides this).\n    *   **Clarify the Temple's Significance:** While mentioning deities Uzdon and Lornu is good, explain *why* Tholon Sarna is held there. Is it for sacrifice, power, or something else?\n    *   **Strengthen the \"New York\" Connection:** The hint about \"New York\" and another world is intriguing. If the source allows, briefly explain *how* this connection is made or *what* it implies about Noork's origins. Is it a memory fragment, a clue left behind, etc.?\n    *   **Doctor Von Mark's Role:** Make it clearer that Von Mark's recognition of \"Captain Dietrich\" directly challenges Noork's amnesiac persona and suggests a deliberate deception.\n\n**3. Nuance and Thematic Depth (if applicable):**\n\n*   **Current Weakness:** The response focuses heavily on plot points. If the story has underlying themes, they could be hinted at.\n*   **Improvement:**\n    *   **Theme of Identity:** Explicitly mention the theme of identity exploration. Noork's journey is not just a physical one but an internal quest to understand who he truly is.\n    *   **Mystery and Suspense:** Emphasize the elements of mystery surrounding Noork's past and the nature of the island.\n\n**4. Conciseness and Word Choice:**\n\n*   **Current Weakness:** Some phrasing is a bit wordy or could be more impactful. For example, \"His primary objective becomes the rescue of a young woman named Tholon Sarna...\" could be more direct.\n*   **Improvement:**\n    *   **Active Voice:** Ensure sentences are primarily in the active voice for a more dynamic feel.\n    *   **Stronger Verbs:** Replace weaker verbs with more evocative ones.\n\n**Revised Example (incorporating some suggestions):**\n\n\"The story plunges into the mystery of Noork, a man stripped of his memory who believes himself to be Captain Dietrich. Stranded in a hostile and unfamiliar land, Noork must contend with the dangerous 'Misty Ones,' beings who hunt and sacrifice humans. As he adapts, learning the local tongue and forging crucial alliances, most notably with Gurn, his central mission crystallizes: the rescue of Tholon Sarna, a young woman held captive within a mysterious temple dedicated to the deities Uzdon and Lornu.\n\nNavigating a treacherous landscape filled with both the supernatural Misty Ones and human guards, Noork gathers intel from allies like Rold, discovering that his formidable enemies are not invincible. His quest for Tholon Sarna is complicated by the appearance of Doctor Von Mark, who claims to recognize Noork as Captain Dietrich and accuses him of faking his amnesia. This encounter, coupled with fragmented hints of a past linked to 'New York' and suggestions of an otherworldly origin brought by a giant bird, intensifies the puzzle of Noork's true identity. Ultimately, the narrative follows Noork's desperate fight to save Tholon Sarna and escape the island, confronting both external dangers and the profound enigma of his own self.\"\n\n**In summary, the response can be improved by:**\n\n*   **Enhancing clarity and flow** with stronger transitions and paragraphing.\n*   **Adding specificity** to descriptions of characters, creatures, and plot points.\n*   **Explicitly mentioning core themes** like identity and mystery.\n*   **Refining word choice and sentence structure** for greater impact and conciseness.", "repetition": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T04:41:15.379207"}, "rouge_score": 0.16422287390029328, "backward_pass_results": {}, "pipeline_success": true}], "rouge_progression": [0.0600375234521576, 0.16422287390029328], "final_rouge": 0.16422287390029328, "rouge_improvement": 0.10418535044813568}}}

When they speak, they learn that Noork has been living with her brother, Gurn.  With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.  He fights the priest, kills him, and frees Sarna.  They go back to the field, get Rold, and the three of them flee into the jungle.  They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle."], "document_text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\nRaiders of the Second Moon\nBy GENE ELLERMAN\nA strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world—to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBeyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was\ngone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman—and ugly, my son.\"\n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchanged—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork.\n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Raiders of the Second Moon, by Gene Ellerman\n\n", "document_length": 33709, "total_iterations": 2, "metadata": {"batch_id": 0, "dataset": "squality", "setting": "test"}}
