The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.

This low score reinforces the idea that the response is not effectively capturing the essence of what would constitute a good plot description.

Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from shoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy. For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been.

Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think not,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island to the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we will paddle boldly across the water.\" \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the shore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite the Temple of Uzdon.\" \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\" said Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will have put a safe distance between us.\" Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands of the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the grassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him.

The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love.

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1945. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray volcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us. But of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by Luna's bulk, we know little. Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in diameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its meaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk, life that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval lake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the starry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth. In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called Noork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the trail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned girl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a sheathed dagger. Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine contours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the insignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration. Not forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged cliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest, and the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had confirmed that belief. For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of the cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour the great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death of the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the words that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated them aloud. \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\" The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going back to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow and stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle giant. Noork grinned. \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her. \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you hunter or escaped slave?\" \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted narl last night when it attacked you.\" Doubtfully the girl put away her bow.

Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and make the Fatherland invincible.\" \"I do not understand too\n\nScore: 0.4037\na leaf-choked pool to wash the stains from the dead man's foggy robe. The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it. Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from shoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy. For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent\n\nScore: 0.3110\nwell,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies? There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a pretense.\" His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain Dietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on Noork's bronzed chest. And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless fingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide belly. He stumbled backward. Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and his men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies. In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him. As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop aside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed. \"Gurn!\" cried Noork. A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother. And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed. Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain Dietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil man when my bird died.\" He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The evil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace with you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\" \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.

One corner of the cavern was walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and toward this Noork made his way. He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\" There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible.

The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle.

He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull.

And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return.

While the response does attempt to summarize the plot, it likely misses key details or presents them in a way that doesn't align with a high-quality summary.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential issues and how to improve the response:\n\n**Potential Issues with the Current Response:**\n\n1.  **Completeness and Key Plot Points:** The current summary covers the main characters (Noork/Dietrich, Sarna, Von Mark) and their general motivations. However, it might be missing crucial plot developments, turning points, or the overarching conflict's resolution that are essential for a comprehensive plot summary. For example, how does Noork regain his memory? What is the significance of the \"Misty Ones\" beyond their role in the sacrifice attempt?\n2.  **Flow and Cohesion:** While the response presents information chronologically, the transitions between different plot threads might be abrupt. The connection between Noork's amnesia, Von Mark's Nazi agenda, and the jungle world's internal conflicts might not be clearly articulated.\n3.  **Character Arc and Motivation Clarity:** While Sarna is introduced as an exile and Gurn as her brother with opposing views, their individual character arcs might not be fully fleshed out in the summary. Similarly, the depth of Noork's internal struggle with amnesia and his eventual acceptance of his identity could be more pronounced.\n4.  **World-Building Integration:** The summary mentions \"jungle world of Sekk,\" \"walled city of Grath,\" \"Vasads,\" and \"Zurans.\" However, the role of these elements in the plot might be unclear. A good plot summary should weave world-building details into the narrative organically, showing how they affect the characters and events.\n5.  **Conciseness vs. Detail:** The ROUGE score could be low if the summary is too brief, omitting important details, or if it's too verbose and includes minor details that dilute the main plot points. The ideal summary strikes a balance.\n6.  **Focus on \"The Story\":** The query is \"What is the plot of the story?\" This implies a need for a narrative summary, not just a list of characters and events. The current response might be too descriptive and less narrative.\n\n**Specific Improvement Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Strengthen the Opening:** Start with a hook that immediately establishes the core conflict or mystery. For instance, instead of just stating Noork has amnesia, hint at the dire circumstances that led him there or the mystery surrounding his presence.\n    *   *Original:* \"The story follows Noork, a man with amnesia who was brought to the jungle world of Sekk by a giant bird.\"\n    *   *Improved:* \"Washed ashore on the mysterious jungle world of Sekk with no memory of his past, the man known as Noork is thrust into a dangerous struggle for survival and discovery.\"\n\n2.  **Clarify Intertwined Conflicts:** Explicitly connect Noork's personal quest with the larger conflicts on Sekk.\n    *   *Improvement:* Clearly explain that Von Mark's presence and his Nazi agenda are the *primary* antagonists, and Noork's amnesia is a *complication* to his mission to stop Von Mark. Show how his encounters with Sarna and her brother Gurn *both aid and complicate* this primary objective.\n\n3.  **Elaborate on Key Turning Points:**\n    *   **Memory Recovery:** If Noork's memory recovery is a significant plot point, describe *how* it happens (e.g., through specific triggers, encounters, or flashbacks). This would add depth to his character arc.\n    *   **The \"Misty Ones\":** Explain their role more clearly. Are they a native force, manipulated by Von Mark, or an independent faction? Their purpose in the plot, beyond kidnapping Sarna, needs to be understood.\n    *   **Confrontation with Von Mark:** Detail the significance of this confrontation. Is it a culmination of Noork's recovered memories and his inherent mission?\n\n4.  **Refine Character Relationships and Motivations:**\n    *   **Noork/Dietrich:** Emphasize the internal conflict between his lost identity and his recovered mission. How does his growing bond with Sarna affect his decision-making?\n    *   **Sarna and Gurn:** Clarify the nature of their exile and their differing ideologies. How do their actions directly impact Noork and the main plot?\n\n5.  **Integrate World-Building Seamlessly:** Instead of just mentioning \"Grath\" or \"Vasads,\" show how these elements are integral to the", "timestamp": "2025-09-22T15:30:00"}}, "additional_metrics": {"chunk_size": 500, "total_chunks": 12, "faiss_index_path": "vector_indexes\\squality_test_batch_0.index", "retrieved_context_length": 41288, "embedding_dimension": 1536}}

Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from shoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy. For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him.

A moment later saw the three of them climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the jungle matted ground outside the wall. \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full voice. Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think not,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island to the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we will paddle boldly across the water.\" \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the shore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite the Temple of Uzdon.\" \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\" said Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will have put a safe distance between us.\" Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands of the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the grassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and make the Fatherland invincible.\" \"I do not understand too\n\nScore: 0.2748\nwell,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies? There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a pretense.\" His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain Dietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on Noork's bronzed chest. And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless fingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide belly. He stumbled backward. Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and his men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies. In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him. As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop aside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed. \"Gurn!\" cried Noork. A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother. And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed. Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain Dietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil man when my bird died.\" He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The evil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace with you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\" \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.

The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions, are not unkind. \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will complete my checking of the gardens.\" Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return.

The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love.

His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony structure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his hands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning gurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon it, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back. The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the shadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully. For a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction of the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then they jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to blood-slippery step. The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man with a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more. He sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a half-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps. In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging out, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle on the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion of the upper temple was muted to a murmur. So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that had dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to battle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm. He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two warriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous gurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes. Noork grinned. From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not snore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed to a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would not give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the room. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged into the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer here in the artificial light of the flickering torch. Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the others. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two others, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle.

There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a pretense.\" His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain Dietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on Noork's bronzed chest. And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless fingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide belly. He stumbled backward. Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and his men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies. In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him. As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop aside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed. \"Gurn!\" cried Noork. A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother. And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed. Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain Dietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil man when my bird died.\" He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The evil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace with you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\" \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.

The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the eye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of rock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for windows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at three distinct levels. Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple. Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another of their number. He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the jaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose rocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the central raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly worked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish colors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed two beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the wolf-headed shape a female. These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura worshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu! Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two upper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty Ones climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to the slaves and common citizens of the island. As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two short swords rose to bar his way. \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere gruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the most beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the sacrifice is chosen.\" Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside. In that instant Noork attacked.\n\nScore: 0.3259\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time. One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with, Noork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. Noork At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread and grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads vanished. These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like this.\" Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at\n\nScore: 0.3222\nhe hurry on down the stone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl, was held prisoner. The steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water dotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two sputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and toward this Noork made his way. He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\" There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white man's legs kept Noork away", "retrieval_context_length": 41178, "intermediate_outputs": {"batch_id": 0, "question": "What is the plot of the story?", "expected_answer": "", "hyperparameters": {"qa_pair_id": "63521_q1", "chunk_size": 500, "batch_id": 0, "repetition": 1}, "evaluation_details": {"qa_pair_id": "63521_q1", "original_query": "What is the plot of the story?", "generated_answer": "The provided context describes a complex narrative involving characters named Noork (also referred to as Captain Dietrich), Sarna, Gurn, Rold, and Doctor Karl Von Mark.

Here's a breakdown of its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Identifies Key Characters and Conflicts:** The response correctly identifies the main characters (Noork/Dietrich, Sarna, Gurn, Rold, Von Mark) and the central conflicts (inter-valley conflict, enslavement, quest for identity).\n*   **Captures Major Plot Points:** It touches upon significant events such as Noork's amnesia, his search for Von Mark, Sarna's capture, the use of \"Misty Ones\" robes, the rescue from the Temple of the Skull, the defeat of Von Mark, and the eventual revelation of Noork's true identity.\n*   **Provides a Conclusive Summary:** It ends with Noork accepting his identity and choosing a peaceful life, which is a crucial part of the resolution.\n\n**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Flow and Cohesion:** The response reads a bit like a list of events rather than a flowing narrative. The transitions between different plot points could be smoother. For example, the mention of \"inter-valley conflict\" feels a bit disconnected from the immediate plot details that follow.\n\n2.  **Clarity of Motivations and Connections:**\n    *   The connection between Noork's initial belief about the giant bird and his quest for Doctor Von Mark could be clearer. While Von Mark is mentioned as a target, the bird aspect seems to be a separate thread that's not fully integrated into the primary goal of finding the scientist.\n    *   The role of Sarna's brother, Gurn, is introduced but his active participation in the *main* plot (the rescue) isn't explicitly detailed beyond him opposing enslavement. He appears more as a supporting character who provides a future option for Noork.\n\n3.  **Minor Inconsistencies/Ambiguities:**\n    *   \"Noork, using stolen 'Misty Ones' robes (which grant invisibility), attempts to rescue Sarna... He collaborates with Rold, a slave, and eventually escapes with Sarna, defeating Von Mark in the process.\" This sentence implies Noork defeated Von Mark during the escape, but the previous sentence mentioned he was on a trail to *find* Von Mark. It's possible Von Mark was present at the temple, but this could be more explicitly stated.\n    *   The sentence \"Noork believes he was brought to Sekk by a giant bird and is searching for another bird that may hold clues to his past\" is mentioned early on, but the bird motif doesn't seem to play a direct role in the *resolution* of the immediate conflict, other than perhaps being tied to Von Mark's machinations.\n\n4.  **ROUGE Score (0.18397626112759644):** This is a relatively low ROUGE score, which suggests that the generated response shares only a small overlap with a reference summary (if one were available for comparison). This low score indicates that the response likely misses key details, rephrases concepts too differently, or omits important information that a human-written summary would include. The suggestions below aim to improve this overlap.\n\n**Specific Improvement Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Structure for Better Flow:**\n    *   **Introduction:** Start with the protagonist's initial state and core motivation.\n    *   **Rising Action:** Detail the events that lead to the central conflict and his attempts to resolve it.\n    *   **Climax:** Describe the main confrontation and rescue.\n    *   **Falling Action/Resolution:** Explain the revelations and the ultimate outcome.\n\n2.  **Refine Character Introductions and Roles:**\n    *   Instead of listing characters upfront, introduce them as they become relevant to Noork's journey.\n    *   Clarify Gurn's role. Is he instrumental in the escape, or is his significance more in the aftermath? The current text implies he's an ally against enslavement but not directly involved in the temple rescue itself.\n\n3.  **Strengthen the Narrative Arc:**\n    *   **Opening:** \"The story follows Noork, an amnesiac who believes he was brought to Sekk by a giant bird. His primary quest is to find Doctor Karl Von Mark, a Nazi scientist, hoping the scientist holds the key to his lost memories and identity.\" (This connects the bird motif to Von Mark more directly as the *hope* for answers).\n    *   **Mid-Point:** \"While searching for Von Mark, Noork encounters Sarna, a Zurani enslaved by priests of Uzdon.

While this score isn't exceptionally high, it indicates that there's some overlap in content between the generated response and the ideal answer (which we don't have direct access to, but can infer from the retrieved information).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the response's strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:\n\n## Evaluation of the Response:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Identifies Key Characters and their Roles:** The response correctly names Noork and Tholon Sarna, and establishes Noork's objective to rescue her. It also mentions Rold and his initial misunderstanding of the Misty Ones.\n*   **Captures the Central Conflict:** The core conflict of Noork infiltrating and fighting the Misty Ones to save Tholon Sarna is present.\n*   **Mentions Important Plot Points:** The disguise, the realization that Misty Ones are killable, the temple (Skull), and the sacrifice are all included.\n*   **Coherent Flow:** The information is presented in a relatively logical order, following Noork's actions and discoveries.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Slightly Disjointed Information:** The response sometimes jumps between different aspects of the plot without smooth transitions. For example, the mention of \"Ud\" and \"Gurn\" feels a bit tacked on at the end.\n*   **Could Be More Concise:** Some sentences could be combined or rephrased for better flow and impact.\n*   **Lacks a Clear Beginning and End:** While it starts with Noork's mission, it doesn't quite feel like a complete narrative arc summary. The ending feels a bit abrupt with the mention of Gurn.\n*   **Redundancy:** The phrase \"men who can die\" is mentioned in relation to Rold's understanding, and then implicitly in Noork's actions.\n*   **Underutilization of Retrieved Information:** While the response mentions key elements, it doesn't fully weave in some of the more evocative details from the retrieved information (e.g., the \"beast-headed stone images\").\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement:\n\nThe goal is to create a more cohesive, engaging, and comprehensive plot summary that flows logically from the beginning to the end.\n\n**1. Structure and Narrative Flow:**\n\n*   **Start with the Setup:** Begin by clearly stating Noork's objective and the initial situation.\n    *   *Original:* \"The plot involves Noork, who is disguised as a Misty One, on a mission to rescue a girl named Tholon Sarna.\"\n    *   *Improved Opening:* \"The story centers on Noork, who infiltrates the island disguised as a Misty One on a critical mission to rescue a young woman named Tholon Sarna.\"\n*   **Develop the Conflict and Discoveries Chronologically:** Group related plot points together.\n    *   **Encounter with Rold:** Detail Noork's interaction with Rold, emphasizing the revelation about the Misty Ones.\n    *   **Noork's Own Discoveries:** Explain how Noork learned to fight and infiltrate the Misty Ones.\n    *   **The Goal and Stakes:** Clearly state where Tholon Sarna is being held and the impending danger (sacrifice).\n    *   **The Plan:** Outline Noork's strategy for rescue and escape.\n*   **Integrate Supporting Details Smoothly:** Weave in details like the temple's description and the statues as context for the setting and the beliefs of the islanders.\n*   **Provide a Stronger Conclusion:** End by summarizing the immediate goal or the next steps. The mention of Gurn is likely an extraneous detail for a plot summary unless it's a crucial turning point that needs more context.\n\n**2. Enhance Conciseness and Clarity:**\n\n*   **Combine Sentences:** Look for opportunities to merge related ideas.\n*   **Refine Wording:** Replace passive voice with active voice where appropriate, and use more impactful vocabulary.\n*   **Eliminate Redundancy:** Ensure concepts are explained clearly without unnecessary repetition.\n\n**3. Leverage All Relevant Retrieved Information:**\n\n*   **Setting Details:** Incorporate the description of the Skull temple and the \"beast-headed stone images\" to enrich the reader's understanding of the island's culture and atmosphere.\n*   **Specific Actions:** Mentioning the use of the bow adds a concrete detail to Noork's combat.\n\n**Specific Examples of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Combining \"Noork explains...\" sentences:**\n    *   *Original:* \"He explains that he killed the owner of the garment he wears and has come to rescue Tholon Sarna.

It also touches upon inhabitants and other locations, hinting at a larger world.\n\nHowever, the ROUGE score of 0.159 is quite low, indicating significant room for improvement in terms of content overlap and quality.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Identifies key locations:** The response correctly picks out the island and its prominent features.\n*   **Mentions inhabitants:** It attempts to include information about the people on the island.\n*   **Hints at a larger world:** Mentioning Grath and the brother's village suggests a broader context.\n\n**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Detail and Specificity:** While it mentions elements like \"jungle\" and \"cultivated fields,\" it doesn't describe their *nature* or *atmosphere*. Are they dense and dangerous, or peaceful and verdant? What do the cultivated fields grow? The \"large, weathered white skull that serves as a temple\" is a vivid image, but the response doesn't elaborate on its significance or how it's integrated into the environment.\n2.  **Ambiguity and Unclear Relationships:**\n    *   \"The 'Misty Ones,' who appear to be the inhabitants or guards of the island\" - The phrase \"appear to be\" suggests uncertainty. The response should state their role more definitively if the source material provides it.\n    *   The relationship between Lake Uzdon and the Temple of the Skull isn't entirely clear. Is the temple *in* the lake, or *by* the lake?\n    *   The connection between Grath and the island is not established. Is it a nearby city, a distant one, or something else?\n3.  **Inconsistent Level of Detail:** The response gives a relatively high level of detail to the skull as a temple but is quite brief on other elements.\n4.  **Lack of Evocative Language:** A good description of a setting should create a sense of place and atmosphere. The current response is very factual and dry.\n5.  **Potential for Redundancy:** \"The story is set on an island. This island features...\" could be more fluid.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nTo improve the RAG response and achieve a higher ROUGE score, the system should focus on extracting more descriptive details and synthesizing them into a cohesive narrative. Here are specific suggestions:\n\n1.  **Enhance Descriptive Language:** Instead of just listing features, the system should aim to extract adjectives and adverbs that describe the *quality* of these features.\n    *   **Instead of:** \"The island features a jungle, cultivated fields...\"\n    *   **Aim for:** \"The island is dominated by a [dense/lush/ancient] jungle, interspersed with [vibrant/parched/carefully tended] cultivated fields...\"\n\n2.  **Elaborate on Key Locations:**\n    *   **Skull Temple:** What is its atmosphere? Is it imposing, sacred, decaying? What is its function beyond being a temple?\n    *   **Lake of Uzdon:** Is it murky, crystal clear, surrounded by unique flora? How does it connect visually or thematically to the Temple of the Skull?\n\n3.  **Clarify Relationships and Roles:**\n    *   **Misty Ones:** Clearly define their role – are they native inhabitants, guardians, priests, something else?\n    *   **Vasads:** What is their role or characteristic? The response introduces them without any context.\n    *   **Grath and Brother's Village:** Briefly explain their geographical or thematic relationship to the island setting. Are they important to the immediate story, or background lore?\n\n4.  **Incorporate Sensory Details (if available in the source):** While RAG typically focuses on factual extraction, if the source material offers sensory details, they should be prioritized. Does the jungle smell damp? Is there a particular sound associated with the island?\n\n5.  **Structure for Flow and Impact:**\n    *   Start with a strong opening statement that establishes the primary setting.\n    *   Group related elements together.\n    *   Conclude with a sentence that might hint at the mood or overarching theme of the setting.\n\n6.  **Prioritize Information:** If the source material is vast, the RAG system should be tuned to prioritize details directly relevant to *describing the setting*. Information about character backstories or plot events might be less relevant to this specific query.\n\n**Example of an Improved Response (Illustrative):**\n\n\"The story unfolds on a mysterious island, a place of stark contrasts.
