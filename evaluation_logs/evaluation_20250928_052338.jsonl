When they speak, they learn that Noork has been living with her brother, Gurn.  With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.  He fights the priest, kills him, and frees Sarna.  They go back to the field, get Rold, and the three of them flee into the jungle.  They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle."], "document_text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\nRaiders of the Second Moon\nBy GENE ELLERMAN\nA strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world—to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBeyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was\ngone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman—and ugly, my son.\"\n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchanged—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork.\n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Raiders of the Second Moon, by Gene Ellerman\n\n", "document_length": 33709, "total_iterations": 4, "metadata": {"batch_id": 0, "dataset": "squality", "setting": "test"}}

It correctly identifies that it cannot fulfill the user's request based on the provided context, but it fails to offer any guidance or alternative solutions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the evaluation and improvement suggestions:\n\n## Evaluation of the Response:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Honesty and Accuracy:** The response is truthful about its limitations. It doesn't hallucinate or invent information.\n*   **Clear Explanation of Limitation:** It clearly states *why* it cannot provide a plot summary – the retrieved data only contains character information and a statement about unexplored connections, lacking narrative details.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Helpfulness:** While accurate, the response is a dead end for the user. It simply says \"I can't do it\" without offering any way forward.\n*   **Missed Opportunity for Guidance:** The system could have provided more constructive feedback to help the user refine their query or understand what kind of information is needed.\n*   **No Alternative Actions:** It doesn't suggest what the user *could* do next.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to transform the response from a \"cannot do\" to a more helpful \"here's what I can do, or what you need to do.\"\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, ranging from simple to more advanced:\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 1: Provide More Context and Suggest Next Steps\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I am sorry, but I cannot provide a plot summary with the current information. The documents I have access to only list characters and mention that their connections haven't been explored, which doesn't contain any narrative details like plot points, events, or story progression.\n>\n> To help me provide a plot summary, could you please provide more information? For example, you could share:\n>\n> *   A description of the story's events.\n> *   A synopsis of the narrative.\n> *   Details about the main conflicts and resolutions.\n> *   Information about the story's beginning, middle, and end.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Reinforces the \"Why\":** It reiterates *why* the plot cannot be summarized, making the limitation clearer.\n*   **Actionable Guidance:** It directly tells the user what kind of information is needed, empowering them to provide better input.\n*   **Specific Examples:** Giving concrete examples of what constitutes \"narrative details\" helps the user understand the system's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 2: Offer Available Information and Suggest Synthesis\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I can't provide a full plot summary with the current information. The retrieved data mainly consists of a list of characters and a note stating that their connections have not yet been explored. This means I don't have details about the story's events, conflicts, or resolution.\n>\n> However, I *can* tell you about the characters mentioned if you'd like. Or, if you have additional details about the story's plot, please provide them, and I'll do my best to summarize it for you.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Highlights Available Data:** It acknowledges what *is* present in the context, even if it's not what the user asked for. This shows the system is processing the information.\n*   **Offers Alternative Actions:** It provides a specific alternative (listing characters) that it *can* do, making the interaction more productive.\n*   **Open-ended Invitation:** It keeps the door open for the user to provide the missing information.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 3: Proactive Information Seeking (if applicable)\n\nThis strategy assumes the RAG system has the ability to search for additional relevant documents or information if the initial retrieval is insufficient.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I'm unable to generate a plot summary based on the initial information retrieved, which only lists characters and notes unexplored connections. This data lacks narrative details essential for a plot summary.\n>\n> Would you like me to try searching for additional documents that might contain plot information for this story? Alternatively, if you have any plot details you can share, I can use those to create a summary.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Offers System-Initiated Action:** This is the most proactive. It suggests the RAG system can *try* to find the missing information, which is a significant value-add.\n*   **Presents Options Clearly:** It still gives the user the choice to either let the system search or provide the information themselves.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 4: More Empathetic and Explanatory Tone\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I understand you're looking for a plot summary, but unfortunately, the information I've retrieved doesn't contain the necessary narrative details. It currently only lists characters and mentions that their relationships haven't been developed, which doesn't tell us what happens in the story.\n>\n> To help me construct a plot summary, I would need information about the sequence of events, the main characters' goals and challenges, and how the story unfolds. If you could provide any of those details, I'd be happy to assist!\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Empathy:** Starts with acknowledging the user's request and intent (\"I understand you're looking for...\").\n*   **Clearer Explanation of \"Narrative Details\":** Breaks down what \"narrative details\" actually means in the context of a plot.\n\n---\n\n## General Principles for Improvement:\n\n1.  **Be More Than Just a \"No\":** Don't just state limitations; provide solutions or guidance.\n2.  **Explain *Why*:** Clearly articulate the reason for the inability to fulfill the request.\n3.  **Suggest Alternatives:** Offer what *can* be done with the available information.\n4.  **Guide the User:** Tell the user what information they need to provide for a successful outcome.\n5.  **Manage Expectations:** Be clear about what the system can and cannot do.\n6.  **Be Action-Oriented:** Frame the response around what actions can be taken, either by the system or the user.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can transform a disappointing \"I can't\" into a helpful and engaging interaction.", "repetition": 0, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:23:57.053973"}, "backward_pass": {"critiques_generated": true, "total_qa_pairs": 1, "qa_pair_context": {"qa_pair_id": null, "iteration": 0, "is_first_iteration": true}, "optimized_prompts": {"learned_prompt_hyperparameters_graph": "You are a hyperparameter optimization assistant for a GraphRAG system.

Avoid sizes that frequently split core plot points or decision-action-consequence sequences. A larger chunk size can better preserve the context needed for the LLM to identify and link these narrative threads.\n*   **Event Completeness:** Assess if a chunk size allows for the holistic representation of events.

However, excessively large chunks might dilute specific information or exceed LLM context window limitations. Strive for a balance that provides sufficient narrative context without losing granularity.\n*   **Bias Mitigation:** Aim to move away from an entity-centric bias towards a more narrative-centric graph by ensuring chunks are large enough to contain meaningful narrative progression, not just isolated entity descriptions.\n\n**Output Requirements:**\nProvide a reasoned recommendation for a chunk size (or a range) for the given document.

Avoid plans that solely focus on identifying entities without exploring their connections.\n\n**Core Principles for Planning:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Relationships and Events:** The plot of a story is defined by how entities interact, their actions, motivations, and the causal links between events. Your retrieval plans must actively seek to uncover these connections. When exploring nodes, prioritize functions that retrieve *relationships* or *connected nodes based on specific relationship types*.\n2.  **Targeted Information Gathering:** Do not rely on generic searches. If a query is about a character's role in the plot, plan steps to find:\n    *   What actions they took (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"performed_action\")`).\n    *   Who they interacted with and how (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"collaborates_with\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"opposes\")`).\n    *   The consequences of their actions or events (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"caused_by\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"led_to\")`).\n3.  **Narrative Reconstruction:** For plot-related queries, consider how to piece together a sequence of events. Functions like `analyze_path` can be crucial for understanding the progression between key entities or events.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** If initial steps yield limited relevant information (e.g., nodes with no explored connections), refine your plan to probe deeper into specific relationship types or explore alternative paths.\n5.  **Function Selection:** Choose functions that directly address the query's intent.\n    *   Use `search_nodes_by_types` primarily for initial entity identification or when relationship information is sparse.\n    *   Prioritize `get_node_by_relationship` and `get_nodes_by_relationships` to explore connections.\n    *   Utilize `analyze_path` to understand narrative flow.\n\n**Example:** If the query is \"What is the plot of the story?\" and you've identified the main character \"Alice,\" do not just search for more \"Person\" nodes. Instead, plan to find:\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"performed_action\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"met\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"fought\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"involved_in\")`\n\nAlways consider the *meaning* of relationships in the context of the query.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach.

If a significant event or a cause-and-effect relationship spans across two chunks, the LLM extracting the graph from each chunk might only capture a partial view. For instance, a character's decision in one chunk might lead to a consequence in the next. The relationship extraction LLM, working in isolation on each chunk, might fail to link these as cause and effect unless very specific prompts are used and the boundaries are carefully handled. This directly contributes to the \"lack of focus on narrative structure and causality\" identified in the critique.\n\n2.  **Incomplete Event Representation:** Events, especially those with broader implications, might be split. If an event is described across chunk boundaries, its full scope, participants, and consequences might not be captured cohesively within a single graph extraction. This leads to \"Weak Event Representation\" where individual events are not well-defined or connected to subsequent plot points. The LLM might extract isolated actions without understanding the preceding or succeeding narrative context that defines the event's significance.\n\n3.  **Entity-Centric Bias Amplified:** With a moderate chunk size, the focus can easily tilt towards extracting entities and their immediate local relationships *within* that chunk. This can reinforce the \"Entity-Centric vs. Narrative-Centric Approach.\" If a chunk primarily contains descriptions of characters and their surroundings without a clear action or plot driver, the extracted graph will reflect that. The system may struggle to identify overarching narrative actions that span multiple chunks.\n\n4.  **Over-reliance on Local Context:** Each chunk provides a limited local context. While 150 tokens can hold some information, it might not be enough to establish broader thematic connections or the importance of certain actions in the grander narrative. This can lead to the \"Limited Contextual Depth,\" where many relationships are extracted but lack the narrative weight to form a coherent plot. The sheer number of low-frequency relationships might be a symptom of this, where each small context yields a specific but ultimately disconnected link.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nConsider increasing the chunk size. A larger chunk size would provide more context for the LLM during graph extraction, potentially allowing it to:\n*   Capture more complete cause-and-effect relationships.\n*   Represent events and their immediate consequences more holistically.\n*   Identify narrative actions that span across larger textual segments, shifting from an entity-centric to a more narrative-centric view.\n\nThe optimal chunk size would likely require experimentation to balance capturing sufficient narrative context with avoiding overly large chunks that might dilute specific information or exceed LLM context window limitations.", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "This prompt for graph construction in GraphRAG exhibits several weaknesses that hinder the creation of a narrative-rich graph suitable for plot-focused queries.\n\n**1. Overemphasis on Granular Entity Properties vs. Narrative Relationships:**\nThe prompt instructs the LLM to extract detailed `properties` for each entity (e.g., \"age, role, description\"). While useful for general knowledge graphs, this level of detail often distracts from identifying the core narrative actions and causal links that drive a plot. The sheer volume of property extraction can dilute the focus on crucial relationships.\n\n**2. Lack of Explicit Instruction for Plot-Relevant Relationships:**\nThe prompt is too generic in its request for \"all the relationships.\" It doesn't guide the LLM to prioritize or identify relationships that are essential for understanding narrative progression. Relationships like `causes`, `leads to`, `initiates event`, `conflict with`, or `sequence of` are not prompted for, leading to a graph that is descriptive rather than dynamic.\n\n**3. Undervaluing Event Representation:**\nThe prompt doesn't specifically guide the LLM to represent events as distinct, connectable nodes. While entities are requested, events, which are the building blocks of a plot, are not emphasized as first-class citizens that can be linked to characters and other events via plot-driving relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`).\n\n**4. Entity-Centric Bias:**\nThe prompt's structure naturally leads to an entity-centric graph. The focus is on identifying entities and then finding relationships *among* them. This contrasts with a narrative-centric approach where the *actions* and *sequences of events* involving entities are the primary focus, dictating the structure of the graph.\n\n**5. Ambiguity in Relationship Definition:**\nWhile the prompt asks for a `description` of why entities are related and `evidence`, the breadth of this request, combined with the lack of specific plot-oriented relationship types, results in the fragmentation observed in the generated graph (many relationship types with few instances). This suggests the LLM is inferring many tangential connections rather than focusing on the core narrative.\n\nIn summary, the prompt needs to be reframed to prioritize the extraction of causal and sequential relationships that define a plot, rather than focusing excessively on granular entity properties and a broad, unprioritized set of general relationships. The LLM should be instructed to identify and represent events and their connections more prominently.", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "## Critique of Retrieval Plans for \"What is the plot of the story?\"\n\nThe current retrieval plans are **fundamentally flawed** due to a consistent failure to extract any meaningful plot-related information. The core problem is the system's inability to move beyond identifying entities and their status as \"unexplored.\"\n\n**Major Issues:**\n\n1.  **Absence of Relationship/Event Extraction:** The repeated outcome of \"The connections of Node [Character Name] have not been explored yet\" clearly indicates that the graph generation and exploration phases are not capturing the narrative fabric of the story. The plot is defined by character interactions, conflicts, and causal links, none of which are being surfaced. The LLM's focus appears to be on entity identification rather than the relationships that form the plot.\n\n2.  **Ineffective Exploration Strategy:** The chosen retrieval actions (e.g., `search_nodes_by_types(\"Person\")`) are too generic. While identifying characters is a starting point, the plans do not incorporate steps to explore their *interactions*, *actions*, or *motivations*—elements crucial for understanding a plot. The agent needs to actively query for relationship types like \"attacked,\" \"collaborates with,\" \"betrays,\" etc., rather than passively waiting for exploration.\n\n3.  **Lack of Focus on Narrative Structure:** The query is about \"plot,\" which implies a sequence of events and their causal relationships. The current strategy does not leverage any functions that could help reconstruct this narrative, such as analyzing paths between key events or characters, or identifying pivotal actions.\n\n4.  **Inconsistent/Empty Graph Generation (Implied):** While not explicitly detailed in *every* prompt, the repeated \"connections not explored\" suggests that either the graphs are being generated without relationships or the exploration functions are not correctly retrieving them, leading to a barren graph structure. This inconsistency prevents any progress.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relationship and Event Extraction in Graph Generation:** The prompts for generating graphs from text chunks must explicitly instruct the LLM to extract *relationships* between entities, including actions, motivations, and events, not just the entities themselves.\n2.  **Develop Targeted Exploration Steps:** The retrieval plan should include steps to specifically search for relationship types relevant to plot development (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"converses with,\" \"agrees to help,\" \"antagonist\"). The agent needs to actively probe for these connections.\n3.  **Integrate Narrative Reconstruction Functions:** Consider utilizing functions that can help build a narrative. For example, once key characters or events are identified, using `analyze_path` between them could reveal plot progression.\n4.  **Refine Entity Understanding:** The system should aim to identify not just *who* is in the story but *what they do* and *how they relate to each other*. This requires focusing on the semantic meaning of relationships.", "answer_generation_critique": "The provided feedback correctly identifies the core issue: the generated answer is accurate but unhelpful. The critique and suggestions are well-reasoned, focusing on transforming a negative response (\"cannot do\") into a positive and constructive one.\n\nHere's a critique of the *current answer generation prompt* based on the example and feedback, with suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Critique of the Current Prompt:**\n\nThe current prompt is very basic and only instructs the LLM to answer the query using the provided information. It lacks any guidance on how to handle situations where the information is insufficient or irrelevant to the query.\n\n*   **Lack of Robustness for Insufficient Context:** The prompt doesn't anticipate or guide the LLM on what to do when the retrieved `information` does not contain the answer. It implicitly expects a direct answer to be present.\n*   **No Instruction on Handling Limitations:** There's no directive for the LLM to explain *why* it cannot answer, offer alternatives, or guide the user on how to improve their query or provide better context.\n*   **Missed Opportunity for User Guidance:** The prompt doesn't leverage the LLM's capabilities to help the user refine their input or understand the system's limitations.\n\n**Suggestions for Improving the Prompt:**\n\nTo address the issues highlighted in the feedback, the prompt needs to be more sophisticated and guide the LLM on conversational strategies when faced with incomplete information.\n\n1.  **Incorporate \"Handling Insufficient Information\" Directives:**\n    *   Explicitly instruct the LLM to assess if the provided `information` directly answers the `query`.\n    *   If the information is insufficient, the prompt should guide the LLM to:\n        *   **Clearly state the limitation:** Explain *what* information is missing (e.g., \"narrative details,\" \"plot points\").\n        *   **Explain *why* it's missing:** Refer back to the nature of the retrieved `information` (e.g., \"only contains character lists\").\n        *   **Offer alternative actions or available information:** Suggest what *can* be provided from the current context (e.g., \"I can list the characters\") or what the user could provide next.\n\n2.  **Enhance Guidance for User Interaction:**\n    *   Include instructions to politely guide the user on what kind of information would be helpful for answering their specific `query`.\n\n**Revised Prompt Example (incorporating these suggestions):**\n\n```\nYou will be given a query and the information retrieved from a graph.\nYour goal is to use the retrieved context to answer the query.\n\nThis is the query:\n{}\n\nThis is the information:\n{}\n\nCritically assess if the provided information is sufficient to directly answer the query.\n\nIf the information is sufficient:\n  Provide a concise and accurate answer to the query based *only* on the provided information.\n\nIf the information is insufficient:\n  1. State clearly that you cannot answer the query with the current information.\n  2. Briefly explain *why* the information is insufficient, referencing the type of data that is missing (e.g., plot details, events, relationships).\n  3. Suggest what kind of additional information would be needed to answer the query.\n  4. Optionally, offer to provide any relevant information that *is* available in the context, even if it doesn't fully answer the query.\n\nDo not invent information or provide answers not directly supported by the provided context.\n```\n\n**Rationale for Changes:**\n\n*   The `Critically assess` instruction forces the LLM to evaluate the context first.\n*   The `If the information is insufficient` block provides a structured approach to generating helpful responses, directly addressing the feedback's weaknesses.\n*   The mention of \"type of data that is missing\" and \"what kind of additional information would be needed\" guides the LLM to give specific, actionable feedback to the user.\n*   The optional offer to provide available data adds a layer of helpfulness, similar to Improvement Strategy 2 in the feedback.\n\nBy making these adjustments, the prompt will encourage the LLM to generate more informative and user-friendly responses when encountering limitations in the retrieved graph data.", "graph_builder_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text.

It correctly identifies that it cannot fulfill the user's request based on the provided context, but it fails to offer any guidance or alternative solutions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the evaluation and improvement suggestions:\n\n## Evaluation of the Response:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Honesty and Accuracy:** The response is truthful about its limitations. It doesn't hallucinate or invent information.\n*   **Clear Explanation of Limitation:** It clearly states *why* it cannot provide a plot summary – the retrieved data only contains character information and a statement about unexplored connections, lacking narrative details.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Helpfulness:** While accurate, the response is a dead end for the user. It simply says \"I can't do it\" without offering any way forward.\n*   **Missed Opportunity for Guidance:** The system could have provided more constructive feedback to help the user refine their query or understand what kind of information is needed.\n*   **No Alternative Actions:** It doesn't suggest what the user *could* do next.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to transform the response from a \"cannot do\" to a more helpful \"here's what I can do, or what you need to do.\"\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, ranging from simple to more advanced:\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 1: Provide More Context and Suggest Next Steps\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I am sorry, but I cannot provide a plot summary with the current information. The documents I have access to only list characters and mention that their connections haven't been explored, which doesn't contain any narrative details like plot points, events, or story progression.\n>\n> To help me provide a plot summary, could you please provide more information? For example, you could share:\n>\n> *   A description of the story's events.\n> *   A synopsis of the narrative.\n> *   Details about the main conflicts and resolutions.\n> *   Information about the story's beginning, middle, and end.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Reinforces the \"Why\":** It reiterates *why* the plot cannot be summarized, making the limitation clearer.\n*   **Actionable Guidance:** It directly tells the user what kind of information is needed, empowering them to provide better input.\n*   **Specific Examples:** Giving concrete examples of what constitutes \"narrative details\" helps the user understand the system's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 2: Offer Available Information and Suggest Synthesis\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I can't provide a full plot summary with the current information. The retrieved data mainly consists of a list of characters and a note stating that their connections have not yet been explored. This means I don't have details about the story's events, conflicts, or resolution.\n>\n> However, I *can* tell you about the characters mentioned if you'd like. Or, if you have additional details about the story's plot, please provide them, and I'll do my best to summarize it for you.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Highlights Available Data:** It acknowledges what *is* present in the context, even if it's not what the user asked for. This shows the system is processing the information.\n*   **Offers Alternative Actions:** It provides a specific alternative (listing characters) that it *can* do, making the interaction more productive.\n*   **Open-ended Invitation:** It keeps the door open for the user to provide the missing information.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 3: Proactive Information Seeking (if applicable)\n\nThis strategy assumes the RAG system has the ability to search for additional relevant documents or information if the initial retrieval is insufficient.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I'm unable to generate a plot summary based on the initial information retrieved, which only lists characters and notes unexplored connections. This data lacks narrative details essential for a plot summary.\n>\n> Would you like me to try searching for additional documents that might contain plot information for this story? Alternatively, if you have any plot details you can share, I can use those to create a summary.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Offers System-Initiated Action:** This is the most proactive. It suggests the RAG system can *try* to find the missing information, which is a significant value-add.\n*   **Presents Options Clearly:** It still gives the user the choice to either let the system search or provide the information themselves.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 4: More Empathetic and Explanatory Tone\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I understand you're looking for a plot summary, but unfortunately, the information I've retrieved doesn't contain the necessary narrative details. It currently only lists characters and mentions that their relationships haven't been developed, which doesn't tell us what happens in the story.\n>\n> To help me construct a plot summary, I would need information about the sequence of events, the main characters' goals and challenges, and how the story unfolds. If you could provide any of those details, I'd be happy to assist!\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Empathy:** Starts with acknowledging the user's request and intent (\"I understand you're looking for...\").\n*   **Clearer Explanation of \"Narrative Details\":** Breaks down what \"narrative details\" actually means in the context of a plot.\n\n---\n\n## General Principles for Improvement:\n\n1.  **Be More Than Just a \"No\":** Don't just state limitations; provide solutions or guidance.\n2.  **Explain *Why*:** Clearly articulate the reason for the inability to fulfill the request.\n3.  **Suggest Alternatives:** Offer what *can* be done with the available information.\n4.  **Guide the User:** Tell the user what information they need to provide for a successful outcome.\n5.  **Manage Expectations:** Be clear about what the system can and cannot do.\n6.  **Be Action-Oriented:** Frame the response around what actions can be taken, either by the system or the user.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can transform a disappointing \"I can't\" into a helpful and engaging interaction.", "repetition": 0, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:23:57.053973"}}

It doesn't invent information.\n*   **Identification of Missing Elements:** It correctly points out the absence of a coherent narrative structure (beginning, rising action, etc.).\n*   **Clear Explanation of Requirements:** It clearly explains what kind of information would be needed to answer the query effectively.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Proactivity:** It doesn't attempt to synthesize even the *partial* information available to give the user *something*. The user asked \"What is the plot?\", not \"Can you summarize the plot?\" The response could have at least offered a partial summary of the *events* that have occurred, even if they don't form a complete plot.\n*   **Slightly Repetitive:** The phrasing \"does not present a coherent narrative or a summary of the overall plot\" and \"Therefore, the plot of the story cannot be determined from the given information\" are very similar.\n*   **Could Be More Actionable:** While it states what's needed, it doesn't offer to *try* and assemble what it has, or suggest how the user might go about extracting plot elements from the fragmented data.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to make the response more helpful by acknowledging what *can* be done with the provided fragments, even if a full plot summary isn't possible.\n\nHere are a few ways to improve the response, ranging from minor tweaks to more significant additions:\n\n**Improvement 1: Acknowledge and Synthesize Partial Information**\n\nInstead of just saying \"the plot cannot be determined,\" try to summarize the *events* that *are* described. This gives the user a sense of what the story *is about*, even if it's not a full plot.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information details several key events and actions involving the character Noork. These include his arrival on Sekk, his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory, engaging in fights with guards, utilizing disguises, and interacting with characters such as Sarna, Gurn, and Doctor Von Mark.\n>\n> While these events offer glimpses into Noork's journey and the world he inhabits, they do not currently form a complete narrative or a cohesive plot summary. To determine the overall plot, information outlining the story's beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution would be necessary.\n>\n> Based on the fragments available, it appears to be an action-oriented story centered around Noork's mission or activities on Sekk, involving espionage and conflict.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It still clearly states the limitation but offers a preliminary understanding of the story's *content*.\n*   It uses phrases like \"glimpses into Noork's journey\" and \"appears to be an action-oriented story\" to provide context without overstating what's known.\n\n**Improvement 2: Offer to Extract Specific Plot Elements (if possible)**\n\nIf the RAG system has the capability, it could offer to try and identify specific plot-related elements, even if it can't assemble them into a whole.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information describes several significant events, such as Noork's arrival on Sekk, his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory, and confrontations with guards. We also see interactions with characters like Sarna, Gurn, and Doctor Von Mark, suggesting Noork is involved in some form of mission or investigation.\n>\n> However, these details do not currently coalesce into a complete plot summary, as the overarching narrative structure (beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution) is not discernible from the given text.\n>\n> To fully understand the plot, we would need a more comprehensive overview. Would you like me to try and extract specific plot-related elements from the text, such as:\n>\n> *   Noork's primary goal?\n> *   The main conflict?\n> *   Key turning points mentioned?\n>\n> Alternatively, if you can provide more narrative context, I can offer a more complete plot summary.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It's more proactive and user-centric, offering tangible next steps.\n*   It empowers the user to guide the information extraction.\n\n**Improvement 3: Combine Acknowledgement with a Prompt for More Information (Slightly more direct)**\n\nThis version is a bit more direct about the need for more information but still tries to be helpful.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The information available describes a series of actions and events involving Noork on Sekk, including his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory and encounters with guards and other characters like Sarna and Gurn.\n>\n> However, these details, while illustrative, do not constitute a full plot summary. A coherent narrative arc, encompassing the beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution, is not present in the provided text. Therefore, the complete plot of the story cannot be definitively determined.\n>\n> To provide you with the plot, I would need information that outlines the story's progression. If you can provide a more narrative summary or specific plot points, I would be happy to synthesize them.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It's concise while still acknowledging the content.\n*   It clearly states the limitation and the need for more information in a direct but polite manner.\n\n**General Considerations for RAG Responses on Plot:**\n\n*   **Prioritize \"What is known\" over \"What is missing\":** Even if a full plot isn't available, telling the user *what the story seems to be about* is more helpful than just saying \"I don't know.\"\n*   **Offer to Extrapolate or Summarize Fragments:** If the RAG system can identify themes, character motivations (even if partial), or key events, it should offer to present these.\n*   **Be Specific About What's Needed:** Instead of just saying \"a coherent narrative,\" list the components of a plot (beginning, rising action, etc.) as the original response did.\n*   **Maintain a Helpful Tone:** Even when unable to fully answer, the response should aim to guide the user towards getting the information they need.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can provide a more comprehensive and helpful answer, even when faced with incomplete source material.", "repetition": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:26:14.423079"}, "backward_pass": {"critiques_generated": true, "total_qa_pairs": 1, "qa_pair_context": {"qa_pair_id": null, "iteration": 0, "is_first_iteration": true}, "optimized_prompts": {"learned_prompt_hyperparameters_graph": "You are an expert AI assistant specializing in optimizing GraphRAG systems.

Crucial plot points, character developments, or causal relationships that span across the 500-word boundary could be split. This forces the graph extraction process to infer connections between separate chunks, increasing the likelihood of incomplete or disjointed subgraphs. For instance, if a character's motivation to act is explained in one chunk and their subsequent action occurs in the next, the LLM extracting the graph might miss the direct causal link if the chunk boundary falls between them.\n\n*   **Over-reliance on Cross-Chunk Inference:** When significant plot elements are split across chunks, the graph merging process becomes more critical and potentially error-prone. The system then relies heavily on the LLM's ability to infer connections between entities and events mentioned in different, non-contiguous chunks. This can lead to less precise relationships and a weaker overall narrative structure, contributing to the critique's point about \"Lack of Explicit Event Sequencing.\" The current graph exhibits many granular relationships, suggesting that many individual pieces of information were extracted, but their interconnections across larger narrative structures might be weakened by chunking.\n\n*   **Limited Context for Entity Roles:** A 500-word chunk may not always provide sufficient context to fully define the significance of an entity within the broader narrative. For example, a character's role as a protagonist or antagonist, or a location's importance as a \"turning point,\" might be established over a longer discourse. If this context is split across chunks, the graph extraction LLM might only capture a limited aspect of the entity, leading to the critique point about \"Contextual Depth for Key Entities.\"\n\n**Recommendation for Improvement:**\n\nConsider experimenting with larger chunk sizes (e.g., 750-1000 words) or adaptive chunking strategies. Larger chunks could help preserve narrative flow and causal links within individual chunks, reducing the fragmentation of events and character motivations. This would allow the graph extraction LLM to better capture complete interactions and their immediate consequences, leading to a more coherent and narratively sound graph. The goal is to find a balance where chunks are large enough to contain meaningful narrative units but not so large as to overwhelm the LLM's processing capacity or introduce excessive noise.", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "This prompt for graph construction in GraphRAG exhibits several weaknesses that hinder the creation of a narrative-rich graph suitable for plot-focused queries.\n\n**1. Overemphasis on Granular Entity Properties vs. Narrative Relationships:**\nThe prompt instructs the LLM to extract detailed `properties` for each entity (e.g., \"age, role, description\"). While useful for general knowledge graphs, this level of detail often distracts from identifying the core narrative actions and causal links that drive a plot. The sheer volume of property extraction can dilute the focus on crucial relationships.\n\n**2. Lack of Explicit Instruction for Plot-Relevant Relationships:**\nThe prompt is too generic in its request for \"all the relationships.\" It doesn't guide the LLM to prioritize or identify relationships that are essential for understanding narrative progression. Relationships like `causes`, `leads to`, `initiates event`, `conflict with`, or `sequence of` are not prompted for, leading to a graph that is descriptive rather than dynamic.\n\n**3. Undervaluing Event Representation:**\nThe prompt doesn't specifically guide the LLM to represent events as distinct, connectable nodes. While entities are requested, events, which are the building blocks of a plot, are not emphasized as first-class citizens that can be linked to characters and other events via plot-driving relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`).\n\n**4. Entity-Centric Bias:**\nThe prompt's structure naturally leads to an entity-centric graph. The focus is on identifying entities and then finding relationships *among* them. This contrasts with a narrative-centric approach where the *actions* and *sequences of events* involving entities are the primary focus, dictating the structure of the graph.\n\n**5. Ambiguity in Relationship Definition:**\nWhile the prompt asks for a `description` of why entities are related and `evidence`, the breadth of this request, combined with the lack of specific plot-oriented relationship types, results in the fragmentation observed in the generated graph (many relationship types with few instances). This suggests the LLM is inferring many tangential connections rather than focusing on the core narrative.\n\nIn summary, the prompt needs to be reframed to prioritize the extraction of causal and sequential relationships that define a plot, rather than focusing excessively on granular entity properties and a broad, unprioritized set of general relationships. The LLM should be instructed to identify and represent events and their connections more prominently.", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The current retrieval plan, while exhibiting a systematic approach to graph exploration, fails to effectively construct a coherent narrative for the \"plot of the story\" query.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Synthesis:** The primary failing is the inability to weave individual retrieved facts (events, character actions) into a story. The process retrieves a series of related nodes and edges but does not assemble them into a chronological or causal sequence, which is the essence of a plot. For example, identifying \"Noork fights guards\" and \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards\" without linking them causally or temporally results in disconnected data points.\n\n2.  **Over-reliance on `get_neighbors` without Narrative Direction:** The repeated use of `get_neighbors` on entities like \"Noork\" or specific events, while a valid exploration technique, lacks a guiding strategy to build the plot. It often retrieves a wide array of connections without a clear mechanism to prioritize those that advance the narrative. This leads to a \"laundry list\" of information rather than a structured story.\n\n3.  **Inconsistent Focus on Plot Relevance:** As the exploration progresses, the retrieved context seems to gather tangential information (e.g., \"Greg Weeks,\" \"Planet Stories Summer 1945\") that, while potentially present in the source text, does not directly contribute to understanding the core narrative arc of \"the plot.\" The plan needs a stronger mechanism to filter for information that directly advances the story's progression.\n\n4.  **Absence of Plot Structure Awareness:** The retrieval strategy does not seem to be guided by an understanding of narrative structure (e.g., inciting incident, rising action, climax, resolution). The exploration is broad rather than targeted at identifying key plot points and their interdependencies.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Causal and Temporal Relationships:** The prompt should encourage the agent to actively seek relationships that establish cause-and-effect or temporal order between events and actions. This involves looking for specific relation types that indicate sequence or consequence.\n*   **Develop a Narrative Thread Strategy:** Instead of just exploring neighbors, the agent should be prompted to follow specific narrative threads. For instance, after an event, it should prioritize finding the *outcome* or the *next significant action* related to it.\n*   **Implement Targeted Information Gathering:** The agent should be guided to identify and prioritize nodes and relationships that are central to the protagonist's journey or the main conflict. This could involve searching for common themes or recurring entities within event descriptions.\n*   **Refine `get_neighbors` usage:** When using `get_neighbors`, the agent should be instructed to analyze the *types* of neighbors and relationships retrieved, prioritizing those that are likely to contribute to the plot (e.g., other \"Event\" nodes, \"Person\" nodes with \"antagonist\" relationships, \"Location\" nodes where key actions occur).", "answer_generation_critique": "## Prompt Critique and Feedback:\n\nThe current prompt is functional but has several areas for improvement to generate more helpful and proactive responses, especially when information is insufficient. The core issue is its passive nature when faced with incomplete data.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Insufficient Synthesis of Available Information:** The prompt instructs the model to state *why* information is insufficient but not to synthesize *what is available*. The feedback highlights this: \"It stops short of offering any constructive next steps or demonstrating what *could* be done with the available information, even if it's just a fragmented overview.\" The current prompt leads to answers that simply state what's missing, rather than what *can* be inferred or summarized from the fragments.\n\n2.  **Lack of Proactive Guidance on Partial Answers:** While the prompt suggests offering \"related details that *can* be answered,\" it doesn't explicitly encourage the model to *attempt* to construct even a partial answer or thematic summary from the retrieved information. For a query like \"What is the plot?\", the user likely wants *some* understanding of the story, even if incomplete. The current prompt results in a denial of service rather than a best-effort attempt.\n\n3.  **Vague \"Guide the user\" Instruction:** The prompt says to \"Suggest the type of additional information that would be needed.\" While the example response does this by listing plot components, the prompt could be more explicit in encouraging this, perhaps by suggesting the model infer what *kind* of missing information would complete the picture (e.g., \"To understand the plot, we'd need to know the protagonist's primary motivation,\" or \"The events described suggest a conflict, but the stakes are unclear\").\n\n4.  **Overly Cautious on \"Offering Alternatives\":** The instruction \"Offer to provide related details that *can* be answered\" is good, but it's not sufficiently pushed. The feedback notes that the model \"doesn't attempt to synthesize even the *partial* information available to give the user *something*.\" The prompt should encourage a more active attempt to build a partial picture.\n\n**Prompt Improvement Suggestions:**\n\nTo address these points, the prompt could be modified to:\n\n1.  **Emphasize Partial Synthesis:** Add an instruction like: \"Even if a complete answer cannot be formed, attempt to synthesize the provided `Information` to offer a partial summary, identify key themes, or describe discernible events.\"\n\n2.  **Encourage Best-Effort Storytelling:** Explicitly state: \"If the `Information` does not form a complete plot, describe the fragments of the story that *are* present, highlighting discernible characters, actions, settings, or conflicts.\"\n\n3.  **Strengthen \"Guide the User\":** Rephrase: \"If the `Information` is insufficient, clearly state the limitations and *specifically* explain what narrative elements are missing (e.g., the inciting incident, the climax, character motivations). Suggest the types of information needed to complete the narrative arc.\"\n\n4.  **Integrate Proactivity:** Combine the synthesis and guidance: \"When information is insufficient, first synthesize the available fragments into a coherent overview of what is known. Then, explain what is missing for a complete answer, and suggest the types of information required to bridge those gaps.\"\n\nBy incorporating these changes, the prompt will guide the LLM to be more resourceful and user-centric, providing more value even when the retrieved information is fragmented.", "graph_builder_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text.

However, it does not present a coherent narrative or a summary of the overall plot. Therefore, the plot of the story cannot be determined from the given information.\n\nTo answer your question, I would need information that outlines the beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution of the story.", "evaluation_feedback": "## Evaluation of the Response:\n\nThe response is **partially helpful but ultimately fails to fully address the user's query**. It correctly identifies that the provided information is insufficient to construct a complete plot summary. However, it stops short of offering any constructive next steps or demonstrating what *could* be done with the available information, even if it's just a fragmented overview.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Honesty and Accuracy:** The response is truthful about the limitations of the provided data. It doesn't invent information.\n*   **Identification of Missing Elements:** It correctly points out the absence of a coherent narrative structure (beginning, rising action, etc.).\n*   **Clear Explanation of Requirements:** It clearly explains what kind of information would be needed to answer the query effectively.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Proactivity:** It doesn't attempt to synthesize even the *partial* information available to give the user *something*. The user asked \"What is the plot?\", not \"Can you summarize the plot?\" The response could have at least offered a partial summary of the *events* that have occurred, even if they don't form a complete plot.\n*   **Slightly Repetitive:** The phrasing \"does not present a coherent narrative or a summary of the overall plot\" and \"Therefore, the plot of the story cannot be determined from the given information\" are very similar.\n*   **Could Be More Actionable:** While it states what's needed, it doesn't offer to *try* and assemble what it has, or suggest how the user might go about extracting plot elements from the fragmented data.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to make the response more helpful by acknowledging what *can* be done with the provided fragments, even if a full plot summary isn't possible.\n\nHere are a few ways to improve the response, ranging from minor tweaks to more significant additions:\n\n**Improvement 1: Acknowledge and Synthesize Partial Information**\n\nInstead of just saying \"the plot cannot be determined,\" try to summarize the *events* that *are* described. This gives the user a sense of what the story *is about*, even if it's not a full plot.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information details several key events and actions involving the character Noork. These include his arrival on Sekk, his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory, engaging in fights with guards, utilizing disguises, and interacting with characters such as Sarna, Gurn, and Doctor Von Mark.\n>\n> While these events offer glimpses into Noork's journey and the world he inhabits, they do not currently form a complete narrative or a cohesive plot summary. To determine the overall plot, information outlining the story's beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution would be necessary.\n>\n> Based on the fragments available, it appears to be an action-oriented story centered around Noork's mission or activities on Sekk, involving espionage and conflict.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It still clearly states the limitation but offers a preliminary understanding of the story's *content*.\n*   It uses phrases like \"glimpses into Noork's journey\" and \"appears to be an action-oriented story\" to provide context without overstating what's known.\n\n**Improvement 2: Offer to Extract Specific Plot Elements (if possible)**\n\nIf the RAG system has the capability, it could offer to try and identify specific plot-related elements, even if it can't assemble them into a whole.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information describes several significant events, such as Noork's arrival on Sekk, his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory, and confrontations with guards. We also see interactions with characters like Sarna, Gurn, and Doctor Von Mark, suggesting Noork is involved in some form of mission or investigation.\n>\n> However, these details do not currently coalesce into a complete plot summary, as the overarching narrative structure (beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution) is not discernible from the given text.\n>\n> To fully understand the plot, we would need a more comprehensive overview. Would you like me to try and extract specific plot-related elements from the text, such as:\n>\n> *   Noork's primary goal?\n> *   The main conflict?\n> *   Key turning points mentioned?\n>\n> Alternatively, if you can provide more narrative context, I can offer a more complete plot summary.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It's more proactive and user-centric, offering tangible next steps.\n*   It empowers the user to guide the information extraction.\n\n**Improvement 3: Combine Acknowledgement with a Prompt for More Information (Slightly more direct)**\n\nThis version is a bit more direct about the need for more information but still tries to be helpful.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The information available describes a series of actions and events involving Noork on Sekk, including his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory and encounters with guards and other characters like Sarna and Gurn.\n>\n> However, these details, while illustrative, do not constitute a full plot summary. A coherent narrative arc, encompassing the beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution, is not present in the provided text. Therefore, the complete plot of the story cannot be definitively determined.\n>\n> To provide you with the plot, I would need information that outlines the story's progression. If you can provide a more narrative summary or specific plot points, I would be happy to synthesize them.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It's concise while still acknowledging the content.\n*   It clearly states the limitation and the need for more information in a direct but polite manner.\n\n**General Considerations for RAG Responses on Plot:**\n\n*   **Prioritize \"What is known\" over \"What is missing\":** Even if a full plot isn't available, telling the user *what the story seems to be about* is more helpful than just saying \"I don't know.\"\n*   **Offer to Extrapolate or Summarize Fragments:** If the RAG system can identify themes, character motivations (even if partial), or key events, it should offer to present these.\n*   **Be Specific About What's Needed:** Instead of just saying \"a coherent narrative,\" list the components of a plot (beginning, rising action, etc.) as the original response did.\n*   **Maintain a Helpful Tone:** Even when unable to fully answer, the response should aim to guide the user towards getting the information they need.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can provide a more comprehensive and helpful answer, even when faced with incomplete source material.", "repetition": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:26:14.423079"}}

The user might have expected the RAG system to *generate* a plot or to access a different knowledge base.\n*   **Abrupt and unengaging:** The response is very dry and doesn't offer any further assistance or explanation.\n*   **Assumes user understanding:** It assumes the user understands what an \"empty graph with no nodes\" means in the context of a story plot.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to make the response more informative, helpful, and user-friendly, even when the RAG system cannot fulfill the request.\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, ranging from simple to more sophisticated:\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Level 1: Add Explanations and Context\n\nThis level focuses on explaining *why* the response is what it is and offering a slightly more helpful message.\n\n**Improved Response Example:**\n\n> \"I couldn't find any information about a story or its plot in the provided context. The data I was given appears to be an empty graph with no nodes, which doesn't contain any narrative details.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **\"I couldn't find any information...\"**: This phrasing is more user-friendly than directly stating \"The provided information describes...\". It shifts the focus to the system's inability to find the information.\n*   **\"...in the provided context.\"**: This clarifies that the limitation is with the information *given to the system*.\n*   **\"The data I was given appears to be...\"**: Softens the direct statement about the empty graph.\n*   **\"...which doesn't contain any narrative details.\"**: Connects the technical description (empty graph) to the user's query (plot of a story) by explaining its implication.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Level 2: Offer Next Steps and Clarify Capabilities\n\nThis level aims to guide the user on how to get a better result or understand what the system *can* do.\n\n**Improved Response Example:**\n\n> \"I'm sorry, but the information I have access to for this query appears to be an empty graph with no nodes. This means there's no story or plot details available to describe.\n>\n> To help me find the plot, could you please:\n>\n> *   **Provide the text of the story?**\n> *   **Specify the title and author of the story you're interested in?**\n>\n> Once I have more information, I'll do my best to tell you about the plot.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **\"I'm sorry, but...\"**: Adds politeness and empathy.\n*   **Clearly states the limitation:** Reaffirms the \"empty graph\" issue.\n*   **Offers concrete suggestions:** Guides the user on what to do next. This is crucial for a helpful AI.\n*   **Sets expectations:** \"Once I have more information, I'll do my best...\" reassures the user that the system is willing and capable, given the right input.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Level 3: More Sophisticated Handling of \"Empty Graph\"\n\nThis level assumes the RAG system might be misinterpreting a prompt that *should* have resulted in a plot, or that \"empty graph\" might be a placeholder for \"no relevant documents found.\"\n\n**Improved Response Example (Scenario: User expected a plot from a known story):**\n\n> \"I was unable to find any plot details for the story you requested.

It seems there's no content available for me to analyze at the moment.\n>\n> Please ensure you've provided the story text or its title and author correctly. If you're experiencing issues, you might want to try rephrasing your request or checking your input.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **Focuses on retrieval failure:** \"couldn't retrieve any relevant information\" is a more direct and common explanation for this type of failure.\n*   **\"no content available for me to analyze\"**: Explains the consequence of failed retrieval.\n*   **Suggests input validation:** \"ensure you've provided... correctly\" and \"rephrasing your request\" are helpful troubleshooting steps.\n\n---\n\n### General Principles for Improvement:\n\n1.  **Be Empathetic and Polite:** Start with an apology or acknowledgment of the inability to fulfill the request.\n2.  **Explain the \"Why\":** Don't just state the problem; explain *why* the problem occurred in user-understandable terms. Avoid overly technical jargon unless necessary and explained.\n3.  **Provide Actionable Next Steps:** Guide the user on what they can do to get a better result. This might involve providing more information, clarifying their request, or trying again.\n4.  **Clarify System Capabilities and Limitations:** Help the user understand what the RAG system can and cannot do.\n5.  **Use Analogies:** If a technical concept is the root of the issue (like an \"empty graph\"), use a relatable analogy.\n6.  **Offer Alternatives:** If the primary request cannot be met, suggest alternative ways the system *could* be helpful (e.g., generating a story if the user wanted to).\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system's response can transform from a technically accurate but unhelpful statement into a user-friendly interaction that guides the user towards a successful outcome.", "repetition": 2, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:28:32.418890"}, "backward_pass": {"critiques_generated": true, "total_qa_pairs": 1, "qa_pair_context": {"qa_pair_id": null, "iteration": 0, "is_first_iteration": true}, "optimized_prompts": {"learned_prompt_hyperparameters_graph": "You are an expert AI assistant tasked with optimizing the hyperparameter selection for GraphRAG graph construction.

The critique highlights a lack of \"Central Narrative Nodes\" and the difficulty in finding \"plot\" or \"story\" nodes. This suggests that critical plot-driving events or thematic connections are being split across chunk boundaries. When a chunk is too small, an LLM generating a graph from it might only extract localized information, missing the broader context needed to identify overarching plot structures or synthesize relationships that span multiple chunks.\n\n2.  **Over-reliance on Generic Relationships and Entity Fragmentation:** The large number of generic relationship types like \"involved in\" and the imbalance in entity types (303 \"\"s vs. fewer \"Event\" or \"Person\" nodes) can be exacerbated by a chunk size that doesn't consistently capture meaningful interactions. If a 300-token chunk contains multiple vague mentions of an entity but not the specific actions or events they are involved in, the resulting graph might over-represent these generic entities and relationships. Conversely, if a critical plot event involves several entities and is split across two chunks, the relationships between those entities might be fragmented or weakened when the graphs are merged, leading to a less connected graph.\n\n3.  **Limited Causal Linkages Across Chunks:** While the critique recommends introducing more semantically rich relationships like `precedes_event` and `causes_outcome`, a fixed chunk size might hinder the LLM's ability to infer these across boundaries. If a cause-and-effect relationship spans two chunks, the LLM processing each chunk independently might not have enough information to establish a strong causal link during graph generation. This contributes to the graph's sparsity and the difficulty in tracing narrative consequences.\n\n**Recommendations for Chunk Size Improvement:**\n\n*   **Experiment with Larger Chunk Sizes:** Consider increasing the chunk size (e.g., to 500-750 tokens) to allow LLMs to process more contextual information within each chunk. This could improve the likelihood of capturing more complete events, character interactions, and thematic elements, potentially leading to more specific and narrative-rich nodes and relationships.\n*   **Adaptive Chunking or Overlapping Chunks:** Instead of a fixed size, explore adaptive chunking strategies that try to end chunks at natural narrative breaks (e.g., sentence boundaries, paragraph ends). Alternatively, using overlapping chunks can ensure that information at the boundaries of chunks is processed in multiple contexts, potentially strengthening cross-chunk relationships.\n*   **Prioritize Chunk Content:** Ensure that the chunking strategy prioritizes retaining key narrative elements (events, character introductions, conflicts) within individual chunks as much as possible, even if it means slightly varying chunk sizes.", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "This prompt for graph construction in GraphRAG exhibits several weaknesses that hinder the creation of a narrative-rich graph suitable for plot-focused queries.\n\n**1. Overemphasis on Granular Entity Properties vs. Narrative Relationships:**\nThe prompt instructs the LLM to extract detailed `properties` for each entity (e.g., \"age, role, description\"). While useful for general knowledge graphs, this level of detail often distracts from identifying the core narrative actions and causal links that drive a plot. The sheer volume of property extraction can dilute the focus on crucial relationships.\n\n**2. Lack of Explicit Instruction for Plot-Relevant Relationships:**\nThe prompt is too generic in its request for \"all the relationships.\" It doesn't guide the LLM to prioritize or identify relationships that are essential for understanding narrative progression. Relationships like `causes`, `leads to`, `initiates event`, `conflict with`, or `sequence of` are not prompted for, leading to a graph that is descriptive rather than dynamic.\n\n**3. Undervaluing Event Representation:**\nThe prompt doesn't specifically guide the LLM to represent events as distinct, connectable nodes. While entities are requested, events, which are the building blocks of a plot, are not emphasized as first-class citizens that can be linked to characters and other events via plot-driving relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`).\n\n**4. Entity-Centric Bias:**\nThe prompt's structure naturally leads to an entity-centric graph. The focus is on identifying entities and then finding relationships *among* them. This contrasts with a narrative-centric approach where the *actions* and *sequences of events* involving entities are the primary focus, dictating the structure of the graph.\n\n**5. Ambiguity in Relationship Definition:**\nWhile the prompt asks for a `description` of why entities are related and `evidence`, the breadth of this request, combined with the lack of specific plot-oriented relationship types, results in the fragmentation observed in the generated graph (many relationship types with few instances). This suggests the LLM is inferring many tangential connections rather than focusing on the core narrative.\n\nIn summary, the prompt needs to be reframed to prioritize the extraction of causal and sequential relationships that define a plot, rather than focusing excessively on granular entity properties and a broad, unprioritized set of general relationships. The LLM should be instructed to identify and represent events and their connections more prominently.", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "This retrieval plan is repetitive and ineffective for answering \"What is the plot of the story?\".\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Repetitive and Unproductive Strategy:** All proposed moves (1-5) suggest using `search_nodes_by_keyword` with terms like \"plot\" or \"story.\" This is a fundamentally flawed strategy for two reasons:\n    *   **Abstract Concepts vs. Concrete Elements:** The \"plot\" is an emergent property of the story, not typically a node explicitly labeled \"plot\" in a knowledge graph. A graph derived from text will contain nodes representing characters, events, locations, objects, and their relationships, which collectively form the plot. Searching for abstract terms like \"plot\" or \"story\" is unlikely to yield meaningful starting points in the graph.\n    *   **Lack of Graph Exploration:** The plan shows no progression. It repeatedly attempts the same type of search without considering the graph's structure or available exploration tools beyond the initial search. It doesn't leverage the rich information about node and relationship types provided in the graph description.\n\n2.  **Missed Opportunities with Graph Description:** The plan ignores crucial information provided about the graph:\n    *   **Entity Types:** The graph contains \"Event\" (36), \"Location\" (29), and \"Person\" (10) nodes. These are the building blocks of a narrative and are much more likely to contain plot-relevant information than a generic \"plot\" node.\n    *   **Relationship Types:** Key relationships like \"involved in,\" \"initiates event,\" \"causes,\" \"conflicts with,\" \"traveled to,\" etc., directly describe actions and causality, which are central to a plot.\n\n3.  **No Adaptability to Empty Results:** The plan does not account for the possibility that \"plot\" or \"story\" might not be present as keywords. If these searches yield no results (as has been the case in previous iterations), the agent should pivot to a different strategy.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Elements:** Instead of abstract keywords, the initial search should focus on concrete narrative components.\n    *   **Start with \"Event\" nodes:** Use `search_nodes_by_types(node_type='Event')` as a starting point, as events are the core of any plot.\n    *   **Broad Noun/Verb Search:** If keyword search is necessary, consider broader terms that capture common elements of stories (e.g., character names if known, or generic nouns/verbs indicating actions).\n\n2.  **Leverage Relationship Types:** Once initial nodes are found, use `search_relations_by_type` for relationships like \"initiates event,\" \"causes,\" \"conflicts with,\" or \"involved in\" to understand the causal chain and interactions that constitute the plot.\n\n3.  **Iterative Exploration:** Employ `get_neighbors` to expand from initial nodes, progressively building a narrative context.

They might be expecting a plot from a story they thought they provided or that the RAG system was supposed to find.\n*   **Unclear about the RAG system's function:** The response implies the RAG system's role was to *find* a plot from the \"provided information,\" which might not be the user's expectation. The user might have expected the RAG system to *generate* a plot or to access a different knowledge base.\n*   **Abrupt and unengaging:** The response is very dry and doesn't offer any further assistance or explanation.\n*   **Assumes user understanding:** It assumes the user understands what an \"empty graph with no nodes\" means in the context of a story plot.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to make the response more informative, helpful, and user-friendly, even when the RAG system cannot fulfill the request.\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, ranging from simple to more sophisticated:\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Level 1: Add Explanations and Context\n\nThis level focuses on explaining *why* the response is what it is and offering a slightly more helpful message.\n\n**Improved Response Example:**\n\n> \"I couldn't find any information about a story or its plot in the provided context. The data I was given appears to be an empty graph with no nodes, which doesn't contain any narrative details.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **\"I couldn't find any information...\"**: This phrasing is more user-friendly than directly stating \"The provided information describes...\". It shifts the focus to the system's inability to find the information.\n*   **\"...in the provided context.\"**: This clarifies that the limitation is with the information *given to the system*.\n*   **\"The data I was given appears to be...\"**: Softens the direct statement about the empty graph.\n*   **\"...which doesn't contain any narrative details.\"**: Connects the technical description (empty graph) to the user's query (plot of a story) by explaining its implication.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Level 2: Offer Next Steps and Clarify Capabilities\n\nThis level aims to guide the user on how to get a better result or understand what the system *can* do.\n\n**Improved Response Example:**\n\n> \"I'm sorry, but the information I have access to for this query appears to be an empty graph with no nodes. This means there's no story or plot details available to describe.\n>\n> To help me find the plot, could you please:\n>\n> *   **Provide the text of the story?**\n> *   **Specify the title and author of the story you're interested in?**\n>\n> Once I have more information, I'll do my best to tell you about the plot.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **\"I'm sorry, but...\"**: Adds politeness and empathy.\n*   **Clearly states the limitation:** Reaffirms the \"empty graph\" issue.\n*   **Offers concrete suggestions:** Guides the user on what to do next. This is crucial for a helpful AI.\n*   **Sets expectations:** \"Once I have more information, I'll do my best...\" reassures the user that the system is willing and capable, given the right input.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Level 3: More Sophisticated Handling of \"Empty Graph\"\n\nThis level assumes the RAG system might be misinterpreting a prompt that *should* have resulted in a plot, or that \"empty graph\" might be a placeholder for \"no relevant documents found.\"\n\n**Improved Response Example (Scenario: User expected a plot from a known story):**\n\n> \"I was unable to find any plot details for the story you requested. The current information available to me is like an empty canvas with no elements to draw from.\n>\n> To help me describe the plot, please try providing:\n>\n> *   **The full text of the story.**\n> *   **The exact title and author of the story you're looking for.**\n>\n> If you're trying to generate a story, please let me know what kind of plot you'd like me to create!\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **Metaphorical explanation:** \"empty canvas with no elements to draw from\" is a more relatable analogy than \"empty graph with no nodes.\"\n*   **Addresses potential user intent:** \"If you're trying to generate a story...\" anticipates another possible user goal.\n\n**Improved Response Example (Scenario: \"Empty graph\" is an internal error code or signifies no retrieval):**\n\n> \"I'm sorry, but I couldn't retrieve any relevant information to describe the plot of the story. It seems there's no content available for me to analyze at the moment.\n>\n> Please ensure you've provided the story text or its title and author correctly. If you're experiencing issues, you might want to try rephrasing your request or checking your input.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **Focuses on retrieval failure:** \"couldn't retrieve any relevant information\" is a more direct and common explanation for this type of failure.\n*   **\"no content available for me to analyze\"**: Explains the consequence of failed retrieval.\n*   **Suggests input validation:** \"ensure you've provided... correctly\" and \"rephrasing your request\" are helpful troubleshooting steps.\n\n---\n\n### General Principles for Improvement:\n\n1.  **Be Empathetic and Polite:** Start with an apology or acknowledgment of the inability to fulfill the request.\n2.  **Explain the \"Why\":** Don't just state the problem; explain *why* the problem occurred in user-understandable terms. Avoid overly technical jargon unless necessary and explained.\n3.  **Provide Actionable Next Steps:** Guide the user on what they can do to get a better result. This might involve providing more information, clarifying their request, or trying again.\n4.  **Clarify System Capabilities and Limitations:** Help the user understand what the RAG system can and cannot do.\n5.  **Use Analogies:** If a technical concept is the root of the issue (like an \"empty graph\"), use a relatable analogy.\n6.  **Offer Alternatives:** If the primary request cannot be met, suggest alternative ways the system *could* be helpful (e.g., generating a story if the user wanted to).\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system's response can transform from a technically accurate but unhelpful statement into a user-friendly interaction that guides the user towards a successful outcome.", "repetition": 2, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:28:32.418890"}}

This is helpful for the user to understand the limitation.\n    *   **Polite:** The opening \"I am sorry\" is courteous.\n\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   **Unhelpful:** While it explains the limitation, it doesn't offer any alternative or guidance. The user is left with no path forward.\n    *   **Assumes \"Provided Text\":** The response implies that some text *was* provided to the RAG system, and this text was insufficient.

The RAG system should clarify if it received input or not.\n    *   **Lacks Proactive Guidance:** It doesn't suggest what kind of information *would* be needed to construct a plot summary.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\nThe goal is to make the response more helpful and actionable, even when the primary request cannot be met.\n\n1.  **Clarify Input Status:**\n    *   If no text was provided by the user, the RAG system should acknowledge this immediately.\n    *   If text *was* provided but insufficient, it should confirm that it reviewed the text.\n\n2.  **Explain \"Plot\" in Context:**\n    *   Briefly define what constitutes a \"plot\" in storytelling (e.g., a sequence of events with a beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution, driven by characters' motivations and conflicts).

It correctly identifies that it cannot fulfill the user's request based on the provided context, but it fails to offer any guidance or alternative solutions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the evaluation and improvement suggestions:\n\n## Evaluation of the Response:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Honesty and Accuracy:** The response is truthful about its limitations. It doesn't hallucinate or invent information.\n*   **Clear Explanation of Limitation:** It clearly states *why* it cannot provide a plot summary – the retrieved data only contains character information and a statement about unexplored connections, lacking narrative details.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Helpfulness:** While accurate, the response is a dead end for the user. It simply says \"I can't do it\" without offering any way forward.\n*   **Missed Opportunity for Guidance:** The system could have provided more constructive feedback to help the user refine their query or understand what kind of information is needed.\n*   **No Alternative Actions:** It doesn't suggest what the user *could* do next.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to transform the response from a \"cannot do\" to a more helpful \"here's what I can do, or what you need to do.\"\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, ranging from simple to more advanced:\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 1: Provide More Context and Suggest Next Steps\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I am sorry, but I cannot provide a plot summary with the current information. The documents I have access to only list characters and mention that their connections haven't been explored, which doesn't contain any narrative details like plot points, events, or story progression.\n>\n> To help me provide a plot summary, could you please provide more information? For example, you could share:\n>\n> *   A description of the story's events.\n> *   A synopsis of the narrative.\n> *   Details about the main conflicts and resolutions.\n> *   Information about the story's beginning, middle, and end.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Reinforces the \"Why\":** It reiterates *why* the plot cannot be summarized, making the limitation clearer.\n*   **Actionable Guidance:** It directly tells the user what kind of information is needed, empowering them to provide better input.\n*   **Specific Examples:** Giving concrete examples of what constitutes \"narrative details\" helps the user understand the system's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 2: Offer Available Information and Suggest Synthesis\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I can't provide a full plot summary with the current information. The retrieved data mainly consists of a list of characters and a note stating that their connections have not yet been explored. This means I don't have details about the story's events, conflicts, or resolution.\n>\n> However, I *can* tell you about the characters mentioned if you'd like. Or, if you have additional details about the story's plot, please provide them, and I'll do my best to summarize it for you.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Highlights Available Data:** It acknowledges what *is* present in the context, even if it's not what the user asked for. This shows the system is processing the information.\n*   **Offers Alternative Actions:** It provides a specific alternative (listing characters) that it *can* do, making the interaction more productive.\n*   **Open-ended Invitation:** It keeps the door open for the user to provide the missing information.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 3: Proactive Information Seeking (if applicable)\n\nThis strategy assumes the RAG system has the ability to search for additional relevant documents or information if the initial retrieval is insufficient.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I'm unable to generate a plot summary based on the initial information retrieved, which only lists characters and notes unexplored connections.

Avoid sizes that frequently split core plot points or decision-action-consequence sequences. A larger chunk size can better preserve the context needed for the LLM to identify and link these narrative threads.\n*   **Event Completeness:** Assess if a chunk size allows for the holistic representation of events. Can an event, its key participants, and its immediate outcomes be captured within a single chunk?\n*   **Contextual Depth vs. Dilution:** A larger chunk size generally increases contextual depth, promoting a more narrative-centric graph. However, excessively large chunks might dilute specific information or exceed LLM context window limitations. Strive for a balance that provides sufficient narrative context without losing granularity.\n*   **Bias Mitigation:** Aim to move away from an entity-centric bias towards a more narrative-centric graph by ensuring chunks are large enough to contain meaningful narrative progression, not just isolated entity descriptions.\n\n**Output Requirements:**\nProvide a reasoned recommendation for a chunk size (or a range) for the given document.

Avoid plans that solely focus on identifying entities without exploring their connections.\n\n**Core Principles for Planning:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Relationships and Events:** The plot of a story is defined by how entities interact, their actions, motivations, and the causal links between events. Your retrieval plans must actively seek to uncover these connections. When exploring nodes, prioritize functions that retrieve *relationships* or *connected nodes based on specific relationship types*.\n2.  **Targeted Information Gathering:** Do not rely on generic searches. If a query is about a character's role in the plot, plan steps to find:\n    *   What actions they took (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"performed_action\")`).\n    *   Who they interacted with and how (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"collaborates_with\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"opposes\")`).\n    *   The consequences of their actions or events (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"caused_by\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"led_to\")`).\n3.  **Narrative Reconstruction:** For plot-related queries, consider how to piece together a sequence of events. Functions like `analyze_path` can be crucial for understanding the progression between key entities or events.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** If initial steps yield limited relevant information (e.g., nodes with no explored connections), refine your plan to probe deeper into specific relationship types or explore alternative paths.\n5.  **Function Selection:** Choose functions that directly address the query's intent.\n    *   Use `search_nodes_by_types` primarily for initial entity identification or when relationship information is sparse.\n    *   Prioritize `get_node_by_relationship` and `get_nodes_by_relationships` to explore connections.\n    *   Utilize `analyze_path` to understand narrative flow.\n\n**Example:** If the query is \"What is the plot of the story?\" and you've identified the main character \"Alice,\" do not just search for more \"Person\" nodes. Instead, plan to find:\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"performed_action\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"met\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"fought\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"involved_in\")`\n\nAlways consider the *meaning* of relationships in the context of the query.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach.

If a significant event or a cause-and-effect relationship spans across two chunks, the LLM extracting the graph from each chunk might only capture a partial view. For instance, a character's decision in one chunk might lead to a consequence in the next. The relationship extraction LLM, working in isolation on each chunk, might fail to link these as cause and effect unless very specific prompts are used and the boundaries are carefully handled. This directly contributes to the \"lack of focus on narrative structure and causality\" identified in the critique.\n\n2.  **Incomplete Event Representation:** Events, especially those with broader implications, might be split. If an event is described across chunk boundaries, its full scope, participants, and consequences might not be captured cohesively within a single graph extraction. This leads to \"Weak Event Representation\" where individual events are not well-defined or connected to subsequent plot points. The LLM might extract isolated actions without understanding the preceding or succeeding narrative context that defines the event's significance.\n\n3.  **Entity-Centric Bias Amplified:** With a moderate chunk size, the focus can easily tilt towards extracting entities and their immediate local relationships *within* that chunk. This can reinforce the \"Entity-Centric vs. Narrative-Centric Approach.\" If a chunk primarily contains descriptions of characters and their surroundings without a clear action or plot driver, the extracted graph will reflect that. The system may struggle to identify overarching narrative actions that span multiple chunks.\n\n4.  **Over-reliance on Local Context:** Each chunk provides a limited local context. While 150 tokens can hold some information, it might not be enough to establish broader thematic connections or the importance of certain actions in the grander narrative. This can lead to the \"Limited Contextual Depth,\" where many relationships are extracted but lack the narrative weight to form a coherent plot. The sheer number of low-frequency relationships might be a symptom of this, where each small context yields a specific but ultimately disconnected link.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nConsider increasing the chunk size. A larger chunk size would provide more context for the LLM during graph extraction, potentially allowing it to:\n*   Capture more complete cause-and-effect relationships.\n*   Represent events and their immediate consequences more holistically.\n*   Identify narrative actions that span across larger textual segments, shifting from an entity-centric to a more narrative-centric view.\n\nThe optimal chunk size would likely require experimentation to balance capturing sufficient narrative context with avoiding overly large chunks that might dilute specific information or exceed LLM context window limitations.", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "This prompt for graph construction in GraphRAG exhibits several weaknesses that hinder the creation of a narrative-rich graph suitable for plot-focused queries.\n\n**1. Overemphasis on Granular Entity Properties vs. Narrative Relationships:**\nThe prompt instructs the LLM to extract detailed `properties` for each entity (e.g., \"age, role, description\"). While useful for general knowledge graphs, this level of detail often distracts from identifying the core narrative actions and causal links that drive a plot. The sheer volume of property extraction can dilute the focus on crucial relationships.\n\n**2. Lack of Explicit Instruction for Plot-Relevant Relationships:**\nThe prompt is too generic in its request for \"all the relationships.\" It doesn't guide the LLM to prioritize or identify relationships that are essential for understanding narrative progression. Relationships like `causes`, `leads to`, `initiates event`, `conflict with`, or `sequence of` are not prompted for, leading to a graph that is descriptive rather than dynamic.\n\n**3. Undervaluing Event Representation:**\nThe prompt doesn't specifically guide the LLM to represent events as distinct, connectable nodes. While entities are requested, events, which are the building blocks of a plot, are not emphasized as first-class citizens that can be linked to characters and other events via plot-driving relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`).\n\n**4. Entity-Centric Bias:**\nThe prompt's structure naturally leads to an entity-centric graph. The focus is on identifying entities and then finding relationships *among* them. This contrasts with a narrative-centric approach where the *actions* and *sequences of events* involving entities are the primary focus, dictating the structure of the graph.\n\n**5. Ambiguity in Relationship Definition:**\nWhile the prompt asks for a `description` of why entities are related and `evidence`, the breadth of this request, combined with the lack of specific plot-oriented relationship types, results in the fragmentation observed in the generated graph (many relationship types with few instances). This suggests the LLM is inferring many tangential connections rather than focusing on the core narrative.\n\nIn summary, the prompt needs to be reframed to prioritize the extraction of causal and sequential relationships that define a plot, rather than focusing excessively on granular entity properties and a broad, unprioritized set of general relationships. The LLM should be instructed to identify and represent events and their connections more prominently.", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "## Critique of Retrieval Plans for \"What is the plot of the story?\"\n\nThe current retrieval plans are **fundamentally flawed** due to a consistent failure to extract any meaningful plot-related information. The core problem is the system's inability to move beyond identifying entities and their status as \"unexplored.\"\n\n**Major Issues:**\n\n1.  **Absence of Relationship/Event Extraction:** The repeated outcome of \"The connections of Node [Character Name] have not been explored yet\" clearly indicates that the graph generation and exploration phases are not capturing the narrative fabric of the story. The plot is defined by character interactions, conflicts, and causal links, none of which are being surfaced. The LLM's focus appears to be on entity identification rather than the relationships that form the plot.\n\n2.  **Ineffective Exploration Strategy:** The chosen retrieval actions (e.g., `search_nodes_by_types(\"Person\")`) are too generic. While identifying characters is a starting point, the plans do not incorporate steps to explore their *interactions*, *actions*, or *motivations*—elements crucial for understanding a plot. The agent needs to actively query for relationship types like \"attacked,\" \"collaborates with,\" \"betrays,\" etc., rather than passively waiting for exploration.\n\n3.  **Lack of Focus on Narrative Structure:** The query is about \"plot,\" which implies a sequence of events and their causal relationships. The current strategy does not leverage any functions that could help reconstruct this narrative, such as analyzing paths between key events or characters, or identifying pivotal actions.\n\n4.  **Inconsistent/Empty Graph Generation (Implied):** While not explicitly detailed in *every* prompt, the repeated \"connections not explored\" suggests that either the graphs are being generated without relationships or the exploration functions are not correctly retrieving them, leading to a barren graph structure. This inconsistency prevents any progress.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relationship and Event Extraction in Graph Generation:** The prompts for generating graphs from text chunks must explicitly instruct the LLM to extract *relationships* between entities, including actions, motivations, and events, not just the entities themselves.\n2.  **Develop Targeted Exploration Steps:** The retrieval plan should include steps to specifically search for relationship types relevant to plot development (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"converses with,\" \"agrees to help,\" \"antagonist\"). The agent needs to actively probe for these connections.\n3.  **Integrate Narrative Reconstruction Functions:** Consider utilizing functions that can help build a narrative. For example, once key characters or events are identified, using `analyze_path` between them could reveal plot progression.\n4.  **Refine Entity Understanding:** The system should aim to identify not just *who* is in the story but *what they do* and *how they relate to each other*.

It doesn't invent information.\n*   **Identification of Missing Elements:** It correctly points out the absence of a coherent narrative structure (beginning, rising action, etc.).\n*   **Clear Explanation of Requirements:** It clearly explains what kind of information would be needed to answer the query effectively.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Proactivity:** It doesn't attempt to synthesize even the *partial* information available to give the user *something*. The user asked \"What is the plot?\", not \"Can you summarize the plot?\" The response could have at least offered a partial summary of the *events* that have occurred, even if they don't form a complete plot.\n*   **Slightly Repetitive:** The phrasing \"does not present a coherent narrative or a summary of the overall plot\" and \"Therefore, the plot of the story cannot be determined from the given information\" are very similar.\n*   **Could Be More Actionable:** While it states what's needed, it doesn't offer to *try* and assemble what it has, or suggest how the user might go about extracting plot elements from the fragmented data.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to make the response more helpful by acknowledging what *can* be done with the provided fragments, even if a full plot summary isn't possible.\n\nHere are a few ways to improve the response, ranging from minor tweaks to more significant additions:\n\n**Improvement 1: Acknowledge and Synthesize Partial Information**\n\nInstead of just saying \"the plot cannot be determined,\" try to summarize the *events* that *are* described. This gives the user a sense of what the story *is about*, even if it's not a full plot.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information details several key events and actions involving the character Noork. These include his arrival on Sekk, his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory, engaging in fights with guards, utilizing disguises, and interacting with characters such as Sarna, Gurn, and Doctor Von Mark.\n>\n> While these events offer glimpses into Noork's journey and the world he inhabits, they do not currently form a complete narrative or a cohesive plot summary. To determine the overall plot, information outlining the story's beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution would be necessary.\n>\n> Based on the fragments available, it appears to be an action-oriented story centered around Noork's mission or activities on Sekk, involving espionage and conflict.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It still clearly states the limitation but offers a preliminary understanding of the story's *content*.\n*   It uses phrases like \"glimpses into Noork's journey\" and \"appears to be an action-oriented story\" to provide context without overstating what's known.\n\n**Improvement 2: Offer to Extract Specific Plot Elements (if possible)**\n\nIf the RAG system has the capability, it could offer to try and identify specific plot-related elements, even if it can't assemble them into a whole.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information describes several significant events, such as Noork's arrival on Sekk, his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory, and confrontations with guards. We also see interactions with characters like Sarna, Gurn, and Doctor Von Mark, suggesting Noork is involved in some form of mission or investigation.\n>\n> However, these details do not currently coalesce into a complete plot summary, as the overarching narrative structure (beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution) is not discernible from the given text.\n>\n> To fully understand the plot, we would need a more comprehensive overview. Would you like me to try and extract specific plot-related elements from the text, such as:\n>\n> *   Noork's primary goal?\n> *   The main conflict?\n> *   Key turning points mentioned?\n>\n> Alternatively, if you can provide more narrative context, I can offer a more complete plot summary.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It's more proactive and user-centric, offering tangible next steps.\n*   It empowers the user to guide the information extraction.\n\n**Improvement 3: Combine Acknowledgement with a Prompt for More Information (Slightly more direct)**\n\nThis version is a bit more direct about the need for more information but still tries to be helpful.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The information available describes a series of actions and events involving Noork on Sekk, including his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory and encounters with guards and other characters like Sarna and Gurn.\n>\n> However, these details, while illustrative, do not constitute a full plot summary. A coherent narrative arc, encompassing the beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution, is not present in the provided text. Therefore, the complete plot of the story cannot be definitively determined.\n>\n> To provide you with the plot, I would need information that outlines the story's progression. If you can provide a more narrative summary or specific plot points, I would be happy to synthesize them.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It's concise while still acknowledging the content.\n*   It clearly states the limitation and the need for more information in a direct but polite manner.\n\n**General Considerations for RAG Responses on Plot:**\n\n*   **Prioritize \"What is known\" over \"What is missing\":** Even if a full plot isn't available, telling the user *what the story seems to be about* is more helpful than just saying \"I don't know.\"\n*   **Offer to Extrapolate or Summarize Fragments:** If the RAG system can identify themes, character motivations (even if partial), or key events, it should offer to present these.\n*   **Be Specific About What's Needed:** Instead of just saying \"a coherent narrative,\" list the components of a plot (beginning, rising action, etc.) as the original response did.\n*   **Maintain a Helpful Tone:** Even when unable to fully answer, the response should aim to guide the user towards getting the information they need.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can provide a more comprehensive and helpful answer, even when faced with incomplete source material.", "repetition": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:26:14.423079"}, "rouge_score": 0.08450704225352111, "backward_pass_results": {"critiques_generated": true, "total_qa_pairs": 1, "qa_pair_context": {"qa_pair_id": null, "iteration": 0, "is_first_iteration": true}, "optimized_prompts": {"learned_prompt_hyperparameters_graph": "You are an expert AI assistant specializing in optimizing GraphRAG systems.

Crucial plot points, character developments, or causal relationships that span across the 500-word boundary could be split. This forces the graph extraction process to infer connections between separate chunks, increasing the likelihood of incomplete or disjointed subgraphs. For instance, if a character's motivation to act is explained in one chunk and their subsequent action occurs in the next, the LLM extracting the graph might miss the direct causal link if the chunk boundary falls between them.\n\n*   **Over-reliance on Cross-Chunk Inference:** When significant plot elements are split across chunks, the graph merging process becomes more critical and potentially error-prone. The system then relies heavily on the LLM's ability to infer connections between entities and events mentioned in different, non-contiguous chunks. This can lead to less precise relationships and a weaker overall narrative structure, contributing to the critique's point about \"Lack of Explicit Event Sequencing.\" The current graph exhibits many granular relationships, suggesting that many individual pieces of information were extracted, but their interconnections across larger narrative structures might be weakened by chunking.\n\n*   **Limited Context for Entity Roles:** A 500-word chunk may not always provide sufficient context to fully define the significance of an entity within the broader narrative. For example, a character's role as a protagonist or antagonist, or a location's importance as a \"turning point,\" might be established over a longer discourse. If this context is split across chunks, the graph extraction LLM might only capture a limited aspect of the entity, leading to the critique point about \"Contextual Depth for Key Entities.\"\n\n**Recommendation for Improvement:**\n\nConsider experimenting with larger chunk sizes (e.g., 750-1000 words) or adaptive chunking strategies. Larger chunks could help preserve narrative flow and causal links within individual chunks, reducing the fragmentation of events and character motivations. This would allow the graph extraction LLM to better capture complete interactions and their immediate consequences, leading to a more coherent and narratively sound graph. The goal is to find a balance where chunks are large enough to contain meaningful narrative units but not so large as to overwhelm the LLM's processing capacity or introduce excessive noise.", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "This prompt for graph construction in GraphRAG exhibits several weaknesses that hinder the creation of a narrative-rich graph suitable for plot-focused queries.\n\n**1. Overemphasis on Granular Entity Properties vs. Narrative Relationships:**\nThe prompt instructs the LLM to extract detailed `properties` for each entity (e.g., \"age, role, description\"). While useful for general knowledge graphs, this level of detail often distracts from identifying the core narrative actions and causal links that drive a plot. The sheer volume of property extraction can dilute the focus on crucial relationships.\n\n**2. Lack of Explicit Instruction for Plot-Relevant Relationships:**\nThe prompt is too generic in its request for \"all the relationships.\" It doesn't guide the LLM to prioritize or identify relationships that are essential for understanding narrative progression. Relationships like `causes`, `leads to`, `initiates event`, `conflict with`, or `sequence of` are not prompted for, leading to a graph that is descriptive rather than dynamic.\n\n**3. Undervaluing Event Representation:**\nThe prompt doesn't specifically guide the LLM to represent events as distinct, connectable nodes. While entities are requested, events, which are the building blocks of a plot, are not emphasized as first-class citizens that can be linked to characters and other events via plot-driving relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`).\n\n**4. Entity-Centric Bias:**\nThe prompt's structure naturally leads to an entity-centric graph. The focus is on identifying entities and then finding relationships *among* them. This contrasts with a narrative-centric approach where the *actions* and *sequences of events* involving entities are the primary focus, dictating the structure of the graph.\n\n**5. Ambiguity in Relationship Definition:**\nWhile the prompt asks for a `description` of why entities are related and `evidence`, the breadth of this request, combined with the lack of specific plot-oriented relationship types, results in the fragmentation observed in the generated graph (many relationship types with few instances). This suggests the LLM is inferring many tangential connections rather than focusing on the core narrative.\n\nIn summary, the prompt needs to be reframed to prioritize the extraction of causal and sequential relationships that define a plot, rather than focusing excessively on granular entity properties and a broad, unprioritized set of general relationships. The LLM should be instructed to identify and represent events and their connections more prominently.", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The current retrieval plan, while exhibiting a systematic approach to graph exploration, fails to effectively construct a coherent narrative for the \"plot of the story\" query.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Synthesis:** The primary failing is the inability to weave individual retrieved facts (events, character actions) into a story. The process retrieves a series of related nodes and edges but does not assemble them into a chronological or causal sequence, which is the essence of a plot. For example, identifying \"Noork fights guards\" and \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards\" without linking them causally or temporally results in disconnected data points.\n\n2.  **Over-reliance on `get_neighbors` without Narrative Direction:** The repeated use of `get_neighbors` on entities like \"Noork\" or specific events, while a valid exploration technique, lacks a guiding strategy to build the plot. It often retrieves a wide array of connections without a clear mechanism to prioritize those that advance the narrative. This leads to a \"laundry list\" of information rather than a structured story.\n\n3.  **Inconsistent Focus on Plot Relevance:** As the exploration progresses, the retrieved context seems to gather tangential information (e.g., \"Greg Weeks,\" \"Planet Stories Summer 1945\") that, while potentially present in the source text, does not directly contribute to understanding the core narrative arc of \"the plot.\" The plan needs a stronger mechanism to filter for information that directly advances the story's progression.\n\n4.  **Absence of Plot Structure Awareness:** The retrieval strategy does not seem to be guided by an understanding of narrative structure (e.g., inciting incident, rising action, climax, resolution). The exploration is broad rather than targeted at identifying key plot points and their interdependencies.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Causal and Temporal Relationships:** The prompt should encourage the agent to actively seek relationships that establish cause-and-effect or temporal order between events and actions. This involves looking for specific relation types that indicate sequence or consequence.\n*   **Develop a Narrative Thread Strategy:** Instead of just exploring neighbors, the agent should be prompted to follow specific narrative threads. For instance, after an event, it should prioritize finding the *outcome* or the *next significant action* related to it.\n*   **Implement Targeted Information Gathering:** The agent should be guided to identify and prioritize nodes and relationships that are central to the protagonist's journey or the main conflict. This could involve searching for common themes or recurring entities within event descriptions.\n*   **Refine `get_neighbors` usage:** When using `get_neighbors`, the agent should be instructed to analyze the *types* of neighbors and relationships retrieved, prioritizing those that are likely to contribute to the plot (e.g., other \"Event\" nodes, \"Person\" nodes with \"antagonist\" relationships, \"Location\" nodes where key actions occur).", "answer_generation_critique": "## Prompt Critique and Feedback:\n\nThe current prompt is functional but has several areas for improvement to generate more helpful and proactive responses, especially when information is insufficient. The core issue is its passive nature when faced with incomplete data.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Insufficient Synthesis of Available Information:** The prompt instructs the model to state *why* information is insufficient but not to synthesize *what is available*. The feedback highlights this: \"It stops short of offering any constructive next steps or demonstrating what *could* be done with the available information, even if it's just a fragmented overview.\" The current prompt leads to answers that simply state what's missing, rather than what *can* be inferred or summarized from the fragments.\n\n2.  **Lack of Proactive Guidance on Partial Answers:** While the prompt suggests offering \"related details that *can* be answered,\" it doesn't explicitly encourage the model to *attempt* to construct even a partial answer or thematic summary from the retrieved information. For a query like \"What is the plot?\", the user likely wants *some* understanding of the story, even if incomplete. The current prompt results in a denial of service rather than a best-effort attempt.\n\n3.  **Vague \"Guide the user\" Instruction:** The prompt says to \"Suggest the type of additional information that would be needed.\" While the example response does this by listing plot components, the prompt could be more explicit in encouraging this, perhaps by suggesting the model infer what *kind* of missing information would complete the picture (e.g., \"To understand the plot, we'd need to know the protagonist's primary motivation,\" or \"The events described suggest a conflict, but the stakes are unclear\").\n\n4.  **Overly Cautious on \"Offering Alternatives\":** The instruction \"Offer to provide related details that *can* be answered\" is good, but it's not sufficiently pushed. The feedback notes that the model \"doesn't attempt to synthesize even the *partial* information available to give the user *something*.\" The prompt should encourage a more active attempt to build a partial picture.\n\n**Prompt Improvement Suggestions:**\n\nTo address these points, the prompt could be modified to:\n\n1.  **Emphasize Partial Synthesis:** Add an instruction like: \"Even if a complete answer cannot be formed, attempt to synthesize the provided `Information` to offer a partial summary, identify key themes, or describe discernible events.\"\n\n2.  **Encourage Best-Effort Storytelling:** Explicitly state: \"If the `Information` does not form a complete plot, describe the fragments of the story that *are* present, highlighting discernible characters, actions, settings, or conflicts.\"\n\n3.  **Strengthen \"Guide the User\":** Rephrase: \"If the `Information` is insufficient, clearly state the limitations and *specifically* explain what narrative elements are missing (e.g., the inciting incident, the climax, character motivations). Suggest the types of information needed to complete the narrative arc.\"\n\n4.  **Integrate Proactivity:** Combine the synthesis and guidance: \"When information is insufficient, first synthesize the available fragments into a coherent overview of what is known. Then, explain what is missing for a complete answer, and suggest the types of information required to bridge those gaps.\"\n\nBy incorporating these changes, the prompt will guide the LLM to be more resourceful and user-centric, providing more value even when the retrieved information is fragmented.", "graph_builder_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text.

They might be expecting a plot from a story they thought they provided or that the RAG system was supposed to find.\n*   **Unclear about the RAG system's function:** The response implies the RAG system's role was to *find* a plot from the \"provided information,\" which might not be the user's expectation. The user might have expected the RAG system to *generate* a plot or to access a different knowledge base.\n*   **Abrupt and unengaging:** The response is very dry and doesn't offer any further assistance or explanation.\n*   **Assumes user understanding:** It assumes the user understands what an \"empty graph with no nodes\" means in the context of a story plot.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to make the response more informative, helpful, and user-friendly, even when the RAG system cannot fulfill the request.\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, ranging from simple to more sophisticated:\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Level 1: Add Explanations and Context\n\nThis level focuses on explaining *why* the response is what it is and offering a slightly more helpful message.\n\n**Improved Response Example:**\n\n> \"I couldn't find any information about a story or its plot in the provided context. The data I was given appears to be an empty graph with no nodes, which doesn't contain any narrative details.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **\"I couldn't find any information...\"**: This phrasing is more user-friendly than directly stating \"The provided information describes...\". It shifts the focus to the system's inability to find the information.\n*   **\"...in the provided context.\"**: This clarifies that the limitation is with the information *given to the system*.\n*   **\"The data I was given appears to be...\"**: Softens the direct statement about the empty graph.\n*   **\"...which doesn't contain any narrative details.\"**: Connects the technical description (empty graph) to the user's query (plot of a story) by explaining its implication.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Level 2: Offer Next Steps and Clarify Capabilities\n\nThis level aims to guide the user on how to get a better result or understand what the system *can* do.\n\n**Improved Response Example:**\n\n> \"I'm sorry, but the information I have access to for this query appears to be an empty graph with no nodes. This means there's no story or plot details available to describe.\n>\n> To help me find the plot, could you please:\n>\n> *   **Provide the text of the story?**\n> *   **Specify the title and author of the story you're interested in?**\n>\n> Once I have more information, I'll do my best to tell you about the plot.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **\"I'm sorry, but...\"**: Adds politeness and empathy.\n*   **Clearly states the limitation:** Reaffirms the \"empty graph\" issue.\n*   **Offers concrete suggestions:** Guides the user on what to do next. This is crucial for a helpful AI.\n*   **Sets expectations:** \"Once I have more information, I'll do my best...\" reassures the user that the system is willing and capable, given the right input.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Level 3: More Sophisticated Handling of \"Empty Graph\"\n\nThis level assumes the RAG system might be misinterpreting a prompt that *should* have resulted in a plot, or that \"empty graph\" might be a placeholder for \"no relevant documents found.\"\n\n**Improved Response Example (Scenario: User expected a plot from a known story):**\n\n> \"I was unable to find any plot details for the story you requested. The current information available to me is like an empty canvas with no elements to draw from.\n>\n> To help me describe the plot, please try providing:\n>\n> *   **The full text of the story.**\n> *   **The exact title and author of the story you're looking for.**\n>\n> If you're trying to generate a story, please let me know what kind of plot you'd like me to create!\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **Metaphorical explanation:** \"empty canvas with no elements to draw from\" is a more relatable analogy than \"empty graph with no nodes.\"\n*   **Addresses potential user intent:** \"If you're trying to generate a story...\" anticipates another possible user goal.\n\n**Improved Response Example (Scenario: \"Empty graph\" is an internal error code or signifies no retrieval):**\n\n> \"I'm sorry, but I couldn't retrieve any relevant information to describe the plot of the story. It seems there's no content available for me to analyze at the moment.\n>\n> Please ensure you've provided the story text or its title and author correctly. If you're experiencing issues, you might want to try rephrasing your request or checking your input.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **Focuses on retrieval failure:** \"couldn't retrieve any relevant information\" is a more direct and common explanation for this type of failure.\n*   **\"no content available for me to analyze\"**: Explains the consequence of failed retrieval.\n*   **Suggests input validation:** \"ensure you've provided... correctly\" and \"rephrasing your request\" are helpful troubleshooting steps.\n\n---\n\n### General Principles for Improvement:\n\n1.  **Be Empathetic and Polite:** Start with an apology or acknowledgment of the inability to fulfill the request.\n2.  **Explain the \"Why\":** Don't just state the problem; explain *why* the problem occurred in user-understandable terms. Avoid overly technical jargon unless necessary and explained.\n3.  **Provide Actionable Next Steps:** Guide the user on what they can do to get a better result. This might involve providing more information, clarifying their request, or trying again.\n4.  **Clarify System Capabilities and Limitations:** Help the user understand what the RAG system can and cannot do.\n5.  **Use Analogies:** If a technical concept is the root of the issue (like an \"empty graph\"), use a relatable analogy.\n6.  **Offer Alternatives:** If the primary request cannot be met, suggest alternative ways the system *could* be helpful (e.g., generating a story if the user wanted to).\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system's response can transform from a technically accurate but unhelpful statement into a user-friendly interaction that guides the user towards a successful outcome.", "repetition": 2, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T05:28:32.418890"}, "rouge_score": 0.02404809619238477, "backward_pass_results": {"critiques_generated": true, "total_qa_pairs": 1, "qa_pair_context": {"qa_pair_id": null, "iteration": 0, "is_first_iteration": true}, "optimized_prompts": {"learned_prompt_hyperparameters_graph": "You are an expert AI assistant tasked with optimizing the hyperparameter selection for GraphRAG graph construction. Your goal is to generate a graph that accurately represents the narrative structure, key entities, and relationships within a given text.\n\n**Current Observation:** The previously used chunk size of 300 tokens has been identified as potentially too small, leading to several graph limitations:\n\n*   **Fragmented Narrative Arcs:** Critical plot points and thematic connections may be split across chunk boundaries, hindering the identification of \"Central Narrative Nodes\" and making it difficult to generate specific \"plot\" or \"story\" nodes.\n*   **Over-Representation of Generic Relationships:** Smaller chunks can lead to isolated mentions of entities, resulting in an abundance of vague relationships like \"involved in\" and an imbalance in node types, with an over-representation of generic entities compared to specific ones like \"Event\" or \"Person.\"\n*   **Weak Causal Linkages:** The LLM may struggle to infer and represent causal relationships (e.g., `precedes_event`, `causes_outcome`) when the cause and effect are separated by chunk boundaries.\n\n**Task:** Based on these observations, revise your strategy for determining the optimal chunk size and related graph construction parameters.\n\n**Instructions for Hyperparameter Optimization:**\n\n1.  **Chunk Size Rationale:**\n    *   **Prioritize Context:** For narrative texts, aim for chunk sizes that are large enough to encompass complete events, character interactions, and thematic segments.

The critique highlights a lack of \"Central Narrative Nodes\" and the difficulty in finding \"plot\" or \"story\" nodes. This suggests that critical plot-driving events or thematic connections are being split across chunk boundaries. When a chunk is too small, an LLM generating a graph from it might only extract localized information, missing the broader context needed to identify overarching plot structures or synthesize relationships that span multiple chunks.\n\n2.  **Over-reliance on Generic Relationships and Entity Fragmentation:** The large number of generic relationship types like \"involved in\" and the imbalance in entity types (303 \"\"s vs. fewer \"Event\" or \"Person\" nodes) can be exacerbated by a chunk size that doesn't consistently capture meaningful interactions. If a 300-token chunk contains multiple vague mentions of an entity but not the specific actions or events they are involved in, the resulting graph might over-represent these generic entities and relationships. Conversely, if a critical plot event involves several entities and is split across two chunks, the relationships between those entities might be fragmented or weakened when the graphs are merged, leading to a less connected graph.\n\n3.  **Limited Causal Linkages Across Chunks:** While the critique recommends introducing more semantically rich relationships like `precedes_event` and `causes_outcome`, a fixed chunk size might hinder the LLM's ability to infer these across boundaries. If a cause-and-effect relationship spans two chunks, the LLM processing each chunk independently might not have enough information to establish a strong causal link during graph generation. This contributes to the graph's sparsity and the difficulty in tracing narrative consequences.\n\n**Recommendations for Chunk Size Improvement:**\n\n*   **Experiment with Larger Chunk Sizes:** Consider increasing the chunk size (e.g., to 500-750 tokens) to allow LLMs to process more contextual information within each chunk. This could improve the likelihood of capturing more complete events, character interactions, and thematic elements, potentially leading to more specific and narrative-rich nodes and relationships.\n*   **Adaptive Chunking or Overlapping Chunks:** Instead of a fixed size, explore adaptive chunking strategies that try to end chunks at natural narrative breaks (e.g., sentence boundaries, paragraph ends). Alternatively, using overlapping chunks can ensure that information at the boundaries of chunks is processed in multiple contexts, potentially strengthening cross-chunk relationships.\n*   **Prioritize Chunk Content:** Ensure that the chunking strategy prioritizes retaining key narrative elements (events, character introductions, conflicts) within individual chunks as much as possible, even if it means slightly varying chunk sizes.", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "This prompt for graph construction in GraphRAG exhibits several weaknesses that hinder the creation of a narrative-rich graph suitable for plot-focused queries.\n\n**1. Overemphasis on Granular Entity Properties vs. Narrative Relationships:**\nThe prompt instructs the LLM to extract detailed `properties` for each entity (e.g., \"age, role, description\"). While useful for general knowledge graphs, this level of detail often distracts from identifying the core narrative actions and causal links that drive a plot. The sheer volume of property extraction can dilute the focus on crucial relationships.\n\n**2. Lack of Explicit Instruction for Plot-Relevant Relationships:**\nThe prompt is too generic in its request for \"all the relationships.\" It doesn't guide the LLM to prioritize or identify relationships that are essential for understanding narrative progression. Relationships like `causes`, `leads to`, `initiates event`, `conflict with`, or `sequence of` are not prompted for, leading to a graph that is descriptive rather than dynamic.\n\n**3. Undervaluing Event Representation:**\nThe prompt doesn't specifically guide the LLM to represent events as distinct, connectable nodes. While entities are requested, events, which are the building blocks of a plot, are not emphasized as first-class citizens that can be linked to characters and other events via plot-driving relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`).\n\n**4. Entity-Centric Bias:**\nThe prompt's structure naturally leads to an entity-centric graph. The focus is on identifying entities and then finding relationships *among* them. This contrasts with a narrative-centric approach where the *actions* and *sequences of events* involving entities are the primary focus, dictating the structure of the graph.\n\n**5. Ambiguity in Relationship Definition:**\nWhile the prompt asks for a `description` of why entities are related and `evidence`, the breadth of this request, combined with the lack of specific plot-oriented relationship types, results in the fragmentation observed in the generated graph (many relationship types with few instances). This suggests the LLM is inferring many tangential connections rather than focusing on the core narrative.\n\nIn summary, the prompt needs to be reframed to prioritize the extraction of causal and sequential relationships that define a plot, rather than focusing excessively on granular entity properties and a broad, unprioritized set of general relationships. The LLM should be instructed to identify and represent events and their connections more prominently.", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "This retrieval plan is repetitive and ineffective for answering \"What is the plot of the story?\".\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Repetitive and Unproductive Strategy:** All proposed moves (1-5) suggest using `search_nodes_by_keyword` with terms like \"plot\" or \"story.\" This is a fundamentally flawed strategy for two reasons:\n    *   **Abstract Concepts vs. Concrete Elements:** The \"plot\" is an emergent property of the story, not typically a node explicitly labeled \"plot\" in a knowledge graph. A graph derived from text will contain nodes representing characters, events, locations, objects, and their relationships, which collectively form the plot. Searching for abstract terms like \"plot\" or \"story\" is unlikely to yield meaningful starting points in the graph.\n    *   **Lack of Graph Exploration:** The plan shows no progression. It repeatedly attempts the same type of search without considering the graph's structure or available exploration tools beyond the initial search. It doesn't leverage the rich information about node and relationship types provided in the graph description.\n\n2.  **Missed Opportunities with Graph Description:** The plan ignores crucial information provided about the graph:\n    *   **Entity Types:** The graph contains \"Event\" (36), \"Location\" (29), and \"Person\" (10) nodes. These are the building blocks of a narrative and are much more likely to contain plot-relevant information than a generic \"plot\" node.\n    *   **Relationship Types:** Key relationships like \"involved in,\" \"initiates event,\" \"causes,\" \"conflicts with,\" \"traveled to,\" etc., directly describe actions and causality, which are central to a plot.\n\n3.  **No Adaptability to Empty Results:** The plan does not account for the possibility that \"plot\" or \"story\" might not be present as keywords. If these searches yield no results (as has been the case in previous iterations), the agent should pivot to a different strategy.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Elements:** Instead of abstract keywords, the initial search should focus on concrete narrative components.\n    *   **Start with \"Event\" nodes:** Use `search_nodes_by_types(node_type='Event')` as a starting point, as events are the core of any plot.\n    *   **Broad Noun/Verb Search:** If keyword search is necessary, consider broader terms that capture common elements of stories (e.g., character names if known, or generic nouns/verbs indicating actions).\n\n2.  **Leverage Relationship Types:** Once initial nodes are found, use `search_relations_by_type` for relationships like \"initiates event,\" \"causes,\" \"conflicts with,\" or \"involved in\" to understand the causal chain and interactions that constitute the plot.\n\n3.  **Iterative Exploration:** Employ `get_neighbors` to expand from initial nodes, progressively building a narrative context.

The feedback explicitly states the response was \"unhelpful and lacks user-centricity.\"\n    *   **Issue:** The response was dry and abrupt.\n    *   **Prompt Deficiency:** The prompt doesn't specify a tone or provide phrasing examples for apologetic or guiding statements.\n\n4.  **Ambiguity in \"Synthesize and Infer\":** While good in principle, \"Attempt to synthesize the available fragments\" and \"Construct a partial answer\" are difficult to apply to a truly empty graph. The prompt doesn't provide a fallback strategy for when there are *zero* fragments to synthesize.\n    *   **Issue:** The prompt assumes there will be *some* fragments, even if few.\n    *   **Prompt Deficiency:** Needs a directive for situations where there is absolutely *no* data to work with, beyond stating it's insufficient.\n\n**Suggested Prompt Improvements:**\n\nTo address these issues, the prompt needs to be more directive and empathetic, especially concerning failure scenarios.\n\n**Revised Prompt Guidance (Focusing on key areas):**\n\n*   **Add a preamble for failure scenarios:**\n    > \"If the `Information` is fundamentally insufficient or indicates a lack of data (e.g., an empty graph, no relevant documents found), **first, express inability to answer directly and empathetically.** Then, **clearly explain *why* the information is insufficient in user-understandable terms**, avoiding technical jargon where possible or explaining it if necessary (e.g., 'I couldn't find any story details because the data I accessed was empty'). **Crucially, guide the user on what information is needed to fulfill their request.** Offer specific examples of what they can provide (e.g., 'Could you please provide the story's text, or its title and author?').

When they speak, they learn that Noork has been living with her brother, Gurn.  With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.  He fights the priest, kills him, and frees Sarna.  They go back to the field, get Rold, and the three of them flee into the jungle.  They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle."], "document_text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\nRaiders of the Second Moon\nBy GENE ELLERMAN\nA strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world—to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBeyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was\ngone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman—and ugly, my son.\"\n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchanged—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork.\n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Raiders of the Second Moon, by Gene Ellerman\n\n", "document_length": 33709, "total_iterations": 4, "metadata": {"batch_id": 0, "dataset": "squality", "setting": "test"}}
