When they speak, they learn that Noork has been living with her brother, Gurn.  With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.  He fights the priest, kills him, and frees Sarna.  They go back to the field, get Rold, and the three of them flee into the jungle.  They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle."], "document_text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\nRaiders of the Second Moon\nBy GENE ELLERMAN\nA strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world—to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBeyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was\ngone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman—and ugly, my son.\"\n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchanged—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork.\n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Raiders of the Second Moon, by Gene Ellerman\n\n", "document_length": 33709, "total_iterations": 2, "metadata": {"batch_id": 0, "dataset": "squality", "setting": "test"}}

However, the lack of plot information makes it impossible to fully assess accuracy regarding the story's narrative.\n*   **Relevance:** **Partially Relevant, but Ultimately Irrelevant.** Identifying characters is *somewhat* relevant to a story's plot, but the primary goal was the plot itself. Stating that the plot details are \"not yet explored\" makes the response largely irrelevant to the user's specific question.\n*   **Clarity:** **Clear, but Unhelpful.** The response is clear in its statement that it cannot provide the plot. However, this clarity is unhelpful to the user's goal.\n*   **Directness:** **Direct, but Negative.** The response directly states it cannot fulfill the request, which is a direct answer, but a negative one.\n*   **Factual Consistency:** **Cannot be assessed.** Without the source document, it's impossible to determine if the character names are factually consistent with the source. However, the statement about plot details not being explored *is* factually consistent with the system's inability to provide them.\n*   **Structure:** **Simple and Direct.** The structure is straightforward, listing characters and then stating the limitation.\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n\nThe core issue is that the RAG system, based on the provided \"information,\" could not retrieve or synthesize the plot. The ideal improvement would be to actually *provide the plot*. However, assuming the system *cannot* find the plot details in its current retrieval, here are ways to improve the *response itself*:\n\n1.  **Be More Explicit About Limitations and Next Steps (if applicable):**\n    *   **Current:** \"The plot details are not yet explored in the provided information.\"\n    *   **Improved:** \"I can identify several characters in this story, including Captain Dietrich, Doctor Karl Von Mark, and Mary Meehan, as well as groups like priests, warriors, and slaves. However, the specific sequence of events that make up the plot is not detailed in the information I have access to. If you have more context or specific sections you'd like me to review, I might be able to provide a more complete summary.\"\n\n2.  **Offer Related Information (if possible and relevant):** If the system *can* extract themes, settings, or character roles, it could offer that instead of just stopping.\n    *   **Example (if themes were available):** \"While I don't have the full plot details, the story seems to involve themes of conflict and social hierarchy, given the presence of warriors and slaves. Captain Dietrich and Doctor Karl Von Mark appear to be significant figures.\"\n\n3.  **Clearly State What Information is MISSING:** Instead of just saying \"not explored,\" it could be more precise.\n    *   **Example:** \"The provided text mentions characters such as Captain Dietrich, Doctor Karl Von Mark, and Mary Meehan, along with roles like priests, warriors, and slaves. However, it does not contain a narrative summary or details about the story's progression, conflicts, or resolution, which are necessary to describe the plot.\"\n\n4.  **Reframe the Response to Manage Expectations:**\n    *   **Current:** Focuses on what's missing.\n    *   **Improved:** Start with the positive (what it *can* identify) and then clearly state the limitation.\n\n**Revised Response Example (incorporating improvements):**\n\n\"This story features a significant cast, including characters like Captain Dietrich, Doctor Karl Von Mark, and Mary Meehan, as well as various societal groups such as priests, warriors, and slaves.

Therefore, I cannot provide a summary of the story's plot at this time.\"\n\n**In summary:** The current response is a polite but unhelpful dead-end. Improvements should focus on:\n*   Being more descriptive about *why* the plot can't be provided (e.g., \"narrative details,\" \"sequence of events\").\n*   Potentially offering any *other* related information that *can* be extracted.\n*   Managing user expectations more effectively by clearly outlining the scope of information available.", "repetition": 0, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T03:21:46.351805"}, "backward_pass": {"critiques_generated": true, "total_qa_pairs": 1, "qa_pair_context": {"qa_pair_id": null, "iteration": 0, "is_first_iteration": true}, "optimized_prompts": {"hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The current chunk size of 256 appears to be **suboptimal** for the GraphRAG system, primarily due to its contribution to the identified issues of insufficient node information and limited narrative structure.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n1.  **Fragmentation of Narrative Events:** A chunk size of 256 might be too small, leading to the arbitrary splitting of related events or character interactions across multiple chunks. If a critical plot point or a significant dialogue occurs within a 256-token window, it might be fragmented, preventing the LLM from extracting a coherent graph representation of that event. This could result in incomplete or disconnected nodes and relationships within individual chunk graphs, hindering the overall narrative understanding.\n\n2.  **Limited Context for Graph Extraction:** When an LLM processes a chunk to extract a graph, a larger chunk size could potentially provide more context about entities and their relationships within that specific segment of text. A 256-token chunk might not be sufficient to capture the full context of a character's motivation, a complex interaction, or the setup for a future event. This limitation directly contributes to the critique that nodes lack descriptive attributes and relationships are too generic, as the LLM has less text to draw upon for richer extraction.\n\n3.  **Potential for Over-Granularity:** Conversely, if the text naturally contains long, detailed passages that describe a single event or a sustained interaction, a 256-token chunk might force a premature split. This could disconnect important details that should ideally be represented within a single graph extraction for a specific chunk, leading to a fragmented understanding of that particular narrative segment.\n\n**Recommendation for Improvement:**\n\nThe chunk size should be **dynamically adjusted or increased** to better capture narrative coherence. Experimenting with larger chunk sizes (e.g., 512, 768, or even higher, within LLM context limits) could allow for:\n\n*   **Holistic Event Representation:** Capturing more complete events and interactions within a single chunk, leading to richer node attributes and more meaningful relationships in the extracted graphs.\n*   **Improved Narrative Flow:** Enabling the LLM to understand the sequence and causality of events more effectively when they are contained within larger, more contextually relevant chunks.\n\nThis adjustment, coupled with improvements to node and relationship enrichment, would directly address the core critique of insufficient information and lack of narrative structure in the current graph.", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The current prompt for graph construction is too simplistic and lacks the specificity required to build a graph that can effectively support narrative-based queries, such as understanding a plot. The primary issues stem from the prompt's failure to guide the LLM in extracting **richer entity properties** and **more descriptive, causal, and temporal relationships**.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1.  **Insufficient Entity Properties:** The prompt asks for \"properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text.\" However, this is too broad. For narrative understanding, properties should focus on aspects crucial to plot development, such as:\n    *   **Roles:** Is the entity a protagonist, antagonist, supporting character, etc.?\n    *   **Motivations/Goals:** What drives the character's actions?\n    *   **Key Attributes:** Significant skills, status, or defining traits relevant to the story.\n    *   **Current State:** (e.g., injured, captured, searching for something).\n\n    *Improvement Suggestion:* The prompt should explicitly request these narrative-relevant properties. For example: \"For each entity, extract *narrative-relevant properties* such as their role in the story, motivations, key characteristics, and current state, if mentioned in the text.\"\n\n2.  **Limited Relationship Semantics and Causality:** The prompt asks for relationship \"type,\" \"description (why you think the two entities are related),\" and \"evidence.\" While \"description\" offers some leeway, the prompt doesn't push for:\n    *   **Causality:** How one event or action leads to another.\n    *   **Temporality:** The sequence of events.\n    *   **Specificity of Action:** \"Interacted with\" is too vague. Relationships like \"attacked,\" \"rescued,\" \"warned,\" \"intends to take\" are better, but more are needed, and they should be consistently extracted.\n\n    *Improvement Suggestion:* The prompt should guide the extraction of more precise relationship types and encourage the capture of causal links. For instance: \"For each relationship, identify its *specific action or connection type* (e.g., 'causes', 'prevents', 'leads to', 'follows', 'motivates', 'warns about'). If a temporal order or causal link is evident, capture it in the relationship description or as a separate attribute.\"\n\n3.  **Lack of Narrative Structure:** The current prompt leads to a collection of entities and pairwise relationships, but not necessarily a cohesive narrative flow. Plot understanding requires connecting events and character arcs. The prompt doesn't explicitly guide the creation of a structure that represents this flow.\n\n    *Improvement Suggestion:* Consider adding instructions to identify and link sequential events or plot points. This could involve a specific relationship type like \"precedes\" or \"follows,\" or encouraging the extraction of \"Event\" nodes that link multiple entities and actions.\n\nIn summary, the prompt needs to be more directive in eliciting information that explicitly describes the *narrative function* of entities and the *causal, temporal, and specific nature* of their interactions, rather than just identifying their presence and general connections. This will enable the retrieval agent to traverse a graph that actually tells a story.", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The retrieval plans provided are ineffective because they fail to engage with the core functionality of graph exploration, leading to a static and uninformative retrieval process.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Failure to Explore:** The most significant issue is the consistent output indicating that no graph exploration has occurred (\"The connections of Node X have not been explored yet.\"). The agent is not utilizing its available functions (like `get_neighbors`, `search_relations_by_type`, etc.) to traverse the graph. This defeats the purpose of a GraphRAG system, which relies on extracting contextual information from graph relationships.\n\n2.  **Lack of Narrative Progression:** The query \"What is the plot of the story?\" requires understanding events, character interactions, conflicts, and resolutions over time. The current approach, which only identifies nodes of type 'Person' without exploring their connections, provides no narrative elements. The retrieved context, being just a list of node names, is insufficient for an LLM to synthesize a plot.\n\n3.  **Static Strategy:** Each iteration follows the same rationale and appears to perform the same non-action. There's no dynamic adaptation or deepening of the search based on initial findings. The strategy should evolve to explore relationships and infer connections relevant to the plot.\n\n4.  **Missed Opportunities for Information:** The prompt provides rich information about entity types and relationship types (e.g., \"attacked,\" \"interacted with,\" \"killed,\" \"leader of,\" \"conquest goal\"). The retrieval plans do not leverage this information to guide the search towards narrative-driving elements. For instance, exploring relationships of type \"attacked\" or \"interacted with\" would be crucial for understanding plot points.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Mandate Graph Traversal:** The planning prompt must explicitly instruct the agent to use exploration functions. The primary goal should be to retrieve *relationships* and *neighboring nodes*, not just to list entity types.\n*   **Prioritize Narrative Elements:** Encourage the agent to look for relationship types that indicate actions, conflicts, motivations, and causal links (e.g., \"attacked,\" \"killed,\" \"intends to take,\" \"deceives,\" \"reason for\").\n*   **Iterative Deepening:** The plan should show progression. If initial exploration yields key characters, the next step should be to explore *their neighbors* and *their relationships* to understand their roles in the story.\n*   **Contextualize Node Selection:** Instead of just searching for all 'Person' nodes, the agent should consider selecting specific persons based on their connectivity or relationships if initial explorations suggest their importance.", "answer_generation_critique": "Critique of the Previous Answer Generation Prompt:\n\nThe previous prompt is too generic and lacks specific instructions to guide the LLM in handling situations where the retrieved information is insufficient to directly answer the query.\n\n**Specific Issues and Improvement Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Guidance for Incomplete Information:** The prompt assumes the retrieved context will always be sufficient. It doesn't instruct the LLM on how to respond when the information is partial or missing crucial details (like the plot in the example).\n    *   **Improvement:** Add instructions like: \"If the provided information is insufficient to fully answer the query, clearly state what information is missing and what *can* be inferred or is known from the provided context. Do not simply state that the information is not available. Instead, try to synthesize what is present.\"\n\n2.  **No Emphasis on Synthesis or Interpretation:** The prompt focuses on \"using the retrieved context to answer the query,\" which can lead to verbatim responses or superficial summaries. It doesn't encourage the LLM to connect disparate pieces of information or infer higher-level details.\n    *   **Improvement:** Explicitly ask the LLM to \"synthesize the information,\" \"connect related pieces of context,\" or \"interpret the information to form a cohesive answer.\" For plot queries, this would mean looking for causal links or sequential information, even if fragmented.\n\n3.  **Absence of Strategy for Partial Answers:** The feedback highlights the need to offer *related* information when the direct answer isn't possible. The prompt does not encourage this.\n    *   **Improvement:** Include a directive such as: \"If the primary query cannot be answered, identify and present any relevant related information that *is* available in the context (e.g., characters, settings, themes, relationships).\"\n\n4.  **Potential for Overly Literal Interpretation:** The current prompt might lead the LLM to stop at the first sign of missing information, as seen in the example's \"The plot details are not yet explored.\"\n    *   **Improvement:** Encourage a more proactive approach: \"Analyze the provided information thoroughly to construct the most complete answer possible, even if some aspects of the query cannot be directly addressed. Explain the limitations transparently.\"\n\n**Revised Prompt Recommendation:**\n\n\"You will be given a query and the information retrieved from a graph.

However, do not simply stop.\n3.  **Provide Partial Answers & Related Information:** If a complete answer isn't possible, provide any relevant information that *is* available. For example, if a plot is requested but not fully detailed, list characters, settings, themes, or known events.\n4.  **Explain Limitations:** Transparently explain the limitations of the available information regarding the query.\n5.  **Directness:** Strive to directly address the query first, before elaborating on limitations or providing related context.\n\nProvide an answer to the query based on these instructions.\"", "graph_builder_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text.

However, the lack of plot information makes it impossible to fully assess accuracy regarding the story's narrative.\n*   **Relevance:** **Partially Relevant, but Ultimately Irrelevant.** Identifying characters is *somewhat* relevant to a story's plot, but the primary goal was the plot itself. Stating that the plot details are \"not yet explored\" makes the response largely irrelevant to the user's specific question.\n*   **Clarity:** **Clear, but Unhelpful.** The response is clear in its statement that it cannot provide the plot. However, this clarity is unhelpful to the user's goal.\n*   **Directness:** **Direct, but Negative.** The response directly states it cannot fulfill the request, which is a direct answer, but a negative one.\n*   **Factual Consistency:** **Cannot be assessed.** Without the source document, it's impossible to determine if the character names are factually consistent with the source. However, the statement about plot details not being explored *is* factually consistent with the system's inability to provide them.\n*   **Structure:** **Simple and Direct.** The structure is straightforward, listing characters and then stating the limitation.\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n\nThe core issue is that the RAG system, based on the provided \"information,\" could not retrieve or synthesize the plot. The ideal improvement would be to actually *provide the plot*. However, assuming the system *cannot* find the plot details in its current retrieval, here are ways to improve the *response itself*:\n\n1.  **Be More Explicit About Limitations and Next Steps (if applicable):**\n    *   **Current:** \"The plot details are not yet explored in the provided information.\"\n    *   **Improved:** \"I can identify several characters in this story, including Captain Dietrich, Doctor Karl Von Mark, and Mary Meehan, as well as groups like priests, warriors, and slaves. However, the specific sequence of events that make up the plot is not detailed in the information I have access to. If you have more context or specific sections you'd like me to review, I might be able to provide a more complete summary.\"\n\n2.  **Offer Related Information (if possible and relevant):** If the system *can* extract themes, settings, or character roles, it could offer that instead of just stopping.\n    *   **Example (if themes were available):** \"While I don't have the full plot details, the story seems to involve themes of conflict and social hierarchy, given the presence of warriors and slaves. Captain Dietrich and Doctor Karl Von Mark appear to be significant figures.\"\n\n3.  **Clearly State What Information is MISSING:** Instead of just saying \"not explored,\" it could be more precise.\n    *   **Example:** \"The provided text mentions characters such as Captain Dietrich, Doctor Karl Von Mark, and Mary Meehan, along with roles like priests, warriors, and slaves. However, it does not contain a narrative summary or details about the story's progression, conflicts, or resolution, which are necessary to describe the plot.\"\n\n4.  **Reframe the Response to Manage Expectations:**\n    *   **Current:** Focuses on what's missing.\n    *   **Improved:** Start with the positive (what it *can* identify) and then clearly state the limitation.\n\n**Revised Response Example (incorporating improvements):**\n\n\"This story features a significant cast, including characters like Captain Dietrich, Doctor Karl Von Mark, and Mary Meehan, as well as various societal groups such as priests, warriors, and slaves. While these characters and groups are present, the specific narrative details that would constitute the plot – such as the main conflict, key events, and resolution – are not detailed in the information I have access to. Therefore, I cannot provide a summary of the story's plot at this time.\"\n\n**In summary:** The current response is a polite but unhelpful dead-end. Improvements should focus on:\n*   Being more descriptive about *why* the plot can't be provided (e.g., \"narrative details,\" \"sequence of events\").\n*   Potentially offering any *other* related information that *can* be extracted.\n*   Managing user expectations more effectively by clearly outlining the scope of information available.", "repetition": 0, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T03:21:46.351805"}, "rouge_score": 0.05791505791505791, "backward_pass_results": {"critiques_generated": true, "total_qa_pairs": 1, "qa_pair_context": {"qa_pair_id": null, "iteration": 0, "is_first_iteration": true}, "optimized_prompts": {"hyperparameters_graph_agent_critique": "The current chunk size of 256 appears to be **suboptimal** for the GraphRAG system, primarily due to its contribution to the identified issues of insufficient node information and limited narrative structure.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n1.  **Fragmentation of Narrative Events:** A chunk size of 256 might be too small, leading to the arbitrary splitting of related events or character interactions across multiple chunks. If a critical plot point or a significant dialogue occurs within a 256-token window, it might be fragmented, preventing the LLM from extracting a coherent graph representation of that event. This could result in incomplete or disconnected nodes and relationships within individual chunk graphs, hindering the overall narrative understanding.\n\n2.  **Limited Context for Graph Extraction:** When an LLM processes a chunk to extract a graph, a larger chunk size could potentially provide more context about entities and their relationships within that specific segment of text. A 256-token chunk might not be sufficient to capture the full context of a character's motivation, a complex interaction, or the setup for a future event. This limitation directly contributes to the critique that nodes lack descriptive attributes and relationships are too generic, as the LLM has less text to draw upon for richer extraction.\n\n3.  **Potential for Over-Granularity:** Conversely, if the text naturally contains long, detailed passages that describe a single event or a sustained interaction, a 256-token chunk might force a premature split. This could disconnect important details that should ideally be represented within a single graph extraction for a specific chunk, leading to a fragmented understanding of that particular narrative segment.\n\n**Recommendation for Improvement:**\n\nThe chunk size should be **dynamically adjusted or increased** to better capture narrative coherence. Experimenting with larger chunk sizes (e.g., 512, 768, or even higher, within LLM context limits) could allow for:\n\n*   **Holistic Event Representation:** Capturing more complete events and interactions within a single chunk, leading to richer node attributes and more meaningful relationships in the extracted graphs.\n*   **Improved Narrative Flow:** Enabling the LLM to understand the sequence and causality of events more effectively when they are contained within larger, more contextually relevant chunks.\n\nThis adjustment, coupled with improvements to node and relationship enrichment, would directly address the core critique of insufficient information and lack of narrative structure in the current graph.", "graph_builder_agent_critique": "The current prompt for graph construction is too simplistic and lacks the specificity required to build a graph that can effectively support narrative-based queries, such as understanding a plot. The primary issues stem from the prompt's failure to guide the LLM in extracting **richer entity properties** and **more descriptive, causal, and temporal relationships**.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1.  **Insufficient Entity Properties:** The prompt asks for \"properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text.\" However, this is too broad. For narrative understanding, properties should focus on aspects crucial to plot development, such as:\n    *   **Roles:** Is the entity a protagonist, antagonist, supporting character, etc.?\n    *   **Motivations/Goals:** What drives the character's actions?\n    *   **Key Attributes:** Significant skills, status, or defining traits relevant to the story.\n    *   **Current State:** (e.g., injured, captured, searching for something).\n\n    *Improvement Suggestion:* The prompt should explicitly request these narrative-relevant properties. For example: \"For each entity, extract *narrative-relevant properties* such as their role in the story, motivations, key characteristics, and current state, if mentioned in the text.\"\n\n2.  **Limited Relationship Semantics and Causality:** The prompt asks for relationship \"type,\" \"description (why you think the two entities are related),\" and \"evidence.\" While \"description\" offers some leeway, the prompt doesn't push for:\n    *   **Causality:** How one event or action leads to another.\n    *   **Temporality:** The sequence of events.\n    *   **Specificity of Action:** \"Interacted with\" is too vague. Relationships like \"attacked,\" \"rescued,\" \"warned,\" \"intends to take\" are better, but more are needed, and they should be consistently extracted.\n\n    *Improvement Suggestion:* The prompt should guide the extraction of more precise relationship types and encourage the capture of causal links. For instance: \"For each relationship, identify its *specific action or connection type* (e.g., 'causes', 'prevents', 'leads to', 'follows', 'motivates', 'warns about'). If a temporal order or causal link is evident, capture it in the relationship description or as a separate attribute.\"\n\n3.  **Lack of Narrative Structure:** The current prompt leads to a collection of entities and pairwise relationships, but not necessarily a cohesive narrative flow. Plot understanding requires connecting events and character arcs. The prompt doesn't explicitly guide the creation of a structure that represents this flow.\n\n    *Improvement Suggestion:* Consider adding instructions to identify and link sequential events or plot points. This could involve a specific relationship type like \"precedes\" or \"follows,\" or encouraging the extraction of \"Event\" nodes that link multiple entities and actions.\n\nIn summary, the prompt needs to be more directive in eliciting information that explicitly describes the *narrative function* of entities and the *causal, temporal, and specific nature* of their interactions, rather than just identifying their presence and general connections. This will enable the retrieval agent to traverse a graph that actually tells a story.", "retrieval_planner_agent_critique": "The retrieval plans provided are ineffective because they fail to engage with the core functionality of graph exploration, leading to a static and uninformative retrieval process.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Failure to Explore:** The most significant issue is the consistent output indicating that no graph exploration has occurred (\"The connections of Node X have not been explored yet.\"). The agent is not utilizing its available functions (like `get_neighbors`, `search_relations_by_type`, etc.) to traverse the graph. This defeats the purpose of a GraphRAG system, which relies on extracting contextual information from graph relationships.\n\n2.  **Lack of Narrative Progression:** The query \"What is the plot of the story?\" requires understanding events, character interactions, conflicts, and resolutions over time. The current approach, which only identifies nodes of type 'Person' without exploring their connections, provides no narrative elements. The retrieved context, being just a list of node names, is insufficient for an LLM to synthesize a plot.\n\n3.  **Static Strategy:** Each iteration follows the same rationale and appears to perform the same non-action. There's no dynamic adaptation or deepening of the search based on initial findings. The strategy should evolve to explore relationships and infer connections relevant to the plot.\n\n4.  **Missed Opportunities for Information:** The prompt provides rich information about entity types and relationship types (e.g., \"attacked,\" \"interacted with,\" \"killed,\" \"leader of,\" \"conquest goal\"). The retrieval plans do not leverage this information to guide the search towards narrative-driving elements. For instance, exploring relationships of type \"attacked\" or \"interacted with\" would be crucial for understanding plot points.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Mandate Graph Traversal:** The planning prompt must explicitly instruct the agent to use exploration functions. The primary goal should be to retrieve *relationships* and *neighboring nodes*, not just to list entity types.\n*   **Prioritize Narrative Elements:** Encourage the agent to look for relationship types that indicate actions, conflicts, motivations, and causal links (e.g., \"attacked,\" \"killed,\" \"intends to take,\" \"deceives,\" \"reason for\").\n*   **Iterative Deepening:** The plan should show progression. If initial exploration yields key characters, the next step should be to explore *their neighbors* and *their relationships* to understand their roles in the story.\n*   **Contextualize Node Selection:** Instead of just searching for all 'Person' nodes, the agent should consider selecting specific persons based on their connectivity or relationships if initial explorations suggest their importance.", "answer_generation_critique": "Critique of the Previous Answer Generation Prompt:\n\nThe previous prompt is too generic and lacks specific instructions to guide the LLM in handling situations where the retrieved information is insufficient to directly answer the query.\n\n**Specific Issues and Improvement Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Guidance for Incomplete Information:** The prompt assumes the retrieved context will always be sufficient. It doesn't instruct the LLM on how to respond when the information is partial or missing crucial details (like the plot in the example).\n    *   **Improvement:** Add instructions like: \"If the provided information is insufficient to fully answer the query, clearly state what information is missing and what *can* be inferred or is known from the provided context. Do not simply state that the information is not available. Instead, try to synthesize what is present.\"\n\n2.  **No Emphasis on Synthesis or Interpretation:** The prompt focuses on \"using the retrieved context to answer the query,\" which can lead to verbatim responses or superficial summaries. It doesn't encourage the LLM to connect disparate pieces of information or infer higher-level details.\n    *   **Improvement:** Explicitly ask the LLM to \"synthesize the information,\" \"connect related pieces of context,\" or \"interpret the information to form a cohesive answer.\" For plot queries, this would mean looking for causal links or sequential information, even if fragmented.\n\n3.  **Absence of Strategy for Partial Answers:** The feedback highlights the need to offer *related* information when the direct answer isn't possible. The prompt does not encourage this.\n    *   **Improvement:** Include a directive such as: \"If the primary query cannot be answered, identify and present any relevant related information that *is* available in the context (e.g., characters, settings, themes, relationships).\"\n\n4.  **Potential for Overly Literal Interpretation:** The current prompt might lead the LLM to stop at the first sign of missing information, as seen in the example's \"The plot details are not yet explored.\"\n    *   **Improvement:** Encourage a more proactive approach: \"Analyze the provided information thoroughly to construct the most complete answer possible, even if some aspects of the query cannot be directly addressed. Explain the limitations transparently.\"\n\n**Revised Prompt Recommendation:**\n\n\"You will be given a query and the information retrieved from a graph. Your goal is to use the retrieved context to answer the query comprehensively.\n\nThis is the query:\n{}\n\nThis is the information:\n{}\n\n**Instructions:**\n1.  **Synthesize and Interpret:** Analyze the provided information to construct the most complete and coherent answer possible. Connect related pieces of context and infer details where appropriate.\n2.  **Handle Insufficient Information:** If the provided information is insufficient to directly or fully answer the query, clearly state what specific information is missing. However, do not simply stop.\n3.  **Provide Partial Answers & Related Information:** If a complete answer isn't possible, provide any relevant information that *is* available. For example, if a plot is requested but not fully detailed, list characters, settings, themes, or known events.\n4.  **Explain Limitations:** Transparently explain the limitations of the available information regarding the query.\n5.  **Directness:** Strive to directly address the query first, before elaborating on limitations or providing related context.\n\nProvide an answer to the query based on these instructions.\"", "graph_builder_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text.

It acknowledges the limitation but doesn't offer any alternative solutions or further assistance.\n*   **Accuracy:** The response is accurate in stating that it cannot provide the plot *with the information given*. It correctly identifies the nature of the retrieved data (nodes and connections without explored relationships).\n*   **Relevance:** The response is directly relevant to the query, as it explains *why* it cannot fulfill the request.\n*   **Clarity:** The response is clear and easy to understand. It uses straightforward language to explain the technical limitation.\n*   **Addressing the Question:** It directly addresses the question by stating it cannot provide the plot. However, it stops there, leaving the user without a resolution.\n*   **Structure:** The response is structured logically, starting with an apology and then explaining the reason.\n*   **Factual Consistency:** The response is factually consistent with the described state of the retrieved information.\n*   **Helpfulness:** While accurate, the response is not very helpful. It identifies a problem but doesn't offer a path forward.\n\n**Areas for Improvement and Suggestions:**\n\nThe core issue is that the RAG system has identified a data limitation and a subsequent inability to answer the question. While it's good to be transparent about limitations, a truly helpful response should go a step further.\n\nHere are several ways the response can be improved, categorized by the aspect they address:\n\n---\n\n**1. Enhancing Helpfulness and User Guidance:**\n\n*   **Suggestion:** Offer actionable steps the user can take or suggest what kind of information is needed.\n*   **Improved Response Example:**\n    > \"I am sorry, but I cannot provide the plot of the story with the information given. The retrieved data describes a vast list of nodes and their connections, but the connections themselves have not been explored. Therefore, the relationships between these elements, which would form the plot, are unknown.\n    >\n    > **To help me provide the plot, could you please specify which specific story you are interested in? If you can provide more context or details about the narrative, I may be able to assist you further.**\"\n\n    *   **Why it's better:** This directly prompts the user for the missing information (the identity of the story) and explains *why* that information is needed.\n\n*   **Suggestion:** If the RAG system has the capability, it could attempt to infer *something* or provide a partial answer based on the available data, even if it's not the full plot.\n*   **Improved Response Example (if possible to infer *any* structure):**\n    > \"I am sorry, but I cannot provide a complete plot of the story with the information given. The retrieved data lists many nodes and their connections, suggesting a complex narrative structure. However, the specific relationships and sequence of events (the plot) have not been detailed or explored within this data.\n    >\n    > **If you could provide the name of the story or more context about its elements, I would be happy to try and piece together the plot for you.**\"\n\n    *   **Why it's better:** This still acknowledges the limitation but subtly hints that the *structure* of information might be known, even if the narrative flow isn't. It also includes the prompt for more information.\n\n---\n\n**2. Refining Clarity and Explaining the \"Why\" More Deeply (if applicable):**\n\n*   **Suggestion:** If the \"nodes and connections\" analogy is too technical, simplify it or provide a more relatable example.\n*   **Improved Response Example:**\n    > \"I'm unable to tell you the plot of the story with the current information. Think of the data I have like a collection of characters and locations, with lines drawn between them showing they interact. However, the actual story – what happens between them, in what order, and why – hasn't been described. Without that narrative sequence, I can't explain the plot.\n    >\n    > **Could you tell me the name of the story you're curious about? With that, I can try to find the actual plot details.**\"\n\n    *   **Why it's better:** The \"characters and locations\" analogy is more intuitive for a general user than \"nodes and connections.\"\n\n---\n\n**3. Adding a Proactive Offer of Related Information (if possible):**\n\n*   **Suggestion:** Even if the plot can't be given, perhaps other related information *is* available.\n*   **Improved Response Example:**\n    > \"I'm sorry, but I can't provide the full plot of the story with the information I have. The data consists of a list of elements (like characters, events, or concepts) and how they are linked, but it doesn't explain the sequence of events or the narrative flow that constitutes the plot.\n    >\n    > **However, if you can tell me the name of the story, I can try to find the plot for you. Alternatively, I might be able to tell you about some of the key elements or characters if you'd like?**\"\n\n    *   **Why it's better:** This offers a fallback option, showing willingness to be helpful even if the primary request can't be met immediately.\n\n---\n\n**4. Structuring for Better User Experience:**\n\n*   **Suggestion:** Use bullet points or clear formatting to separate the apology, the explanation, and the proposed next steps.\n*   **Improved Response Example:**\n    > \"I cannot provide the plot of the story based on the information I currently have. Here's why:\n    >\n    > *   **Data Limitation:** The retrieved data lists elements (nodes) and their connections, but the actual narrative sequence or story development within those connections is missing.\n    > *   **Missing Information:** Without exploring the relationships between these elements, the plot – which describes 'what happens' – remains unknown.\n    >\n    > **To help me answer your question, please provide:**\n    >\n    > *   The name of the story you are interested in.\n    >\n    > Once I have this information, I will do my best to find and present the plot to you.\"\n\n    *   **Why it's better:** This structured approach makes the limitations and the required next steps very clear and easy for the user to digest.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Improvements:**\n\nThe main goal is to move from simply stating a limitation to actively guiding the user towards a resolution. This involves:\n\n1.  **Asking for clarification:** Prompting the user for the missing piece of information (e.g., the story's title).\n2.  **Explaining the need:** Clearly stating *why* that information is required.\n3.  **Offering alternatives:** Suggesting related information that *might* be available.\n4.  **Simplifying technical jargon:** Using more accessible language if necessary.\n5.  **Structuring for clarity:** Using formatting to make the response easy to read and understand.", "repetition": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-28T03:22:23.326120"}, "rouge_score": 0.056925996204933584, "backward_pass_results": {}, "pipeline_success": true}], "rouge_progression": [0.05791505791505791, 0.056925996204933584], "final_rouge": 0.056925996204933584, "rouge_improvement": -0.0009890617101243268}}}

When they speak, they learn that Noork has been living with her brother, Gurn.  With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.  He fights the priest, kills him, and frees Sarna.  They go back to the field, get Rold, and the three of them flee into the jungle.  They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle."], "document_text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\nRaiders of the Second Moon\nBy GENE ELLERMAN\nA strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world—to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBeyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was\ngone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman—and ugly, my son.\"\n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchanged—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork.\n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Raiders of the Second Moon, by Gene Ellerman\n\n", "document_length": 33709, "total_iterations": 2, "metadata": {"batch_id": 0, "dataset": "squality", "setting": "test"}}
