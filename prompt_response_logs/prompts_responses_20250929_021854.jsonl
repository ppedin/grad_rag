Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall.

The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design.

He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.

It feels more like a collection of facts than a story synopsis. The connections between events could be clearer.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracies or Ambiguities:**\n    *   \"He learns that these Misty Ones are not immortal demons, but men.\" This is a crucial reveal, but the phrasing could be smoother.\n    *   The role of the \"Misty Ones\" themselves beyond being \"men\" could be clarified if they play a more active role or are distinct from the general populace.\n    *   \"potentially with the help of other escaped slaves\" is a bit vague.\n*   **Information Overload/Clutter:** The inclusion of details like Sarna's father's name might be too granular for a general plot summary, especially if they don't significantly drive the main plot forward. This can dilute the core narrative.\n*   **Focus on \"What\" over \"How\" and \"Why\":** The response tells us *what* happens but could do a better job of explaining *how* Noork plans to achieve his goals or *why* he is so driven.\n*   **ROUGE Score Interpretation:** A low ROUGE score indicates that the generated response has low overlap with a reference summary (which we don't have, but can infer based on good summary practices). This suggests the model might be missing key phrases or conceptual links that would be present in a well-written summary. It might be generating sentences that are grammatically correct but don't capture the essence of the plot as effectively as a human would.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Enhance Narrative Structure and Flow:**\n    *   **Start with the inciting incident:** Noork's arrival on the island and his immediate goal.\n    *   **Introduce the conflict:** The impending sacrifice of Tholon Sarna.\n    *   **Describe the rising action:** Noork's alliance with Rold, the plan to infiltrate the temple.\n    *   **Hint at the stakes and challenges:** The priests, the Uzdon cult, the danger of the mission.\n    *   **Conclude with the overarching objective:** The rescue and the potential broader implications (e.g., escaping the island, confronting Uzdon).\n    *   *Example of improved flow:* \"The story centers on Noork, an exile who has escaped from a jungle world to reach an island inhabited by the 'Misty Ones.' Upon arrival, he discovers these inhabitants are not demons but men, and he soon learns of a dire situation: a young woman named Tholon Sarna is being held captive by the priests of Uzdon, intended as a sacrifice to their god. Driven by a mission to rescue Sarna, Noork partners with Rold, a local slave originally from the city of Konto. Together, they devise a daring plan to infiltrate the heavily guarded Temple of the Skull and save Sarna, possibly with the aid of other escaped slaves.\"\n\n2.  **Refine Character Introductions and Roles:**\n    *   Clarify the \"Misty Ones\" distinction more smoothly.\n    *   Ensure Rold's motivation or importance is clear – why does he help Noork? (Perhaps loyalty, shared desire for freedom).\n    *   *Improvement:* Instead of \"He learns that these Misty Ones are not immortal demons, but men,\" try: \"On this island, inhabited by people known as the 'Misty Ones,' Noork discovers they are not supernatural beings but ordinary men.\"\n\n3.  **Prioritize Key Plot Points:**\n    *   Evaluate if details like Sarna's father's name are essential for a *plot* summary.

Lack of Cohesion and Narrative Flow:** The retrieved chunks are disjointed and jump between different plot points without a clear progression. For instance, Iteration 1 jumps from Noork interacting with Rold to an escape scene, and then to Noork's origin story. Iteration 2 similarly mixes his interaction with Sarna, a flashback about Gurn, and a scene with Rold. This fragmented retrieval makes it difficult for the LLM to construct a coherent understanding of the narrative.\n\n**2. Repetitive and Redundant Information:** Multiple chunks cover similar events or introduce the same characters repeatedly. For example, Noork's encounter with Rold and the revelation about the Misty Ones are present in multiple iterations (Iteration 1, Iteration 2). This redundancy wastes valuable context window space and doesn't add new information.\n\n**3. Inconsistent Focus:** The system retrieves snippets that are too granular or focus on minor details, such as descriptions of clothing or brief dialogues. While these might be present in the source text, they don't contribute significantly to the main plot points required to answer a summary-level query. For example, the detailed description of Noork's disguise in Iteration 3 doesn't directly advance the understanding of his mission.\n\n**4. Missing Key Plot Points:** Crucial information for understanding the overall narrative is either absent or buried within less relevant text. For example, while Sarna's captivity and sacrificial fate are mentioned, the specific details of the Temple of Uzdon, the rituals, and the direct plan for rescue are not consistently or clearly presented across the retrieved chunks. The role of \"Gurn\" and his connection to Noork and Sarna is also fragmented.\n\n**To improve retrieval:**\n\n*   **Prioritize thematic relevance:** Instead of simply embedding and retrieving chunks based on keyword similarity, the system should prioritize chunks that contribute to the overarching narrative and character motivations.\n*   **Implement chunk summarization or hierarchical retrieval:** For longer documents, consider a two-stage retrieval process where initial summaries are retrieved, and then more specific chunks are fetched based on the promising summaries.\n*   **Refine the query generation:** The LLM agent refining queries should be guided to generate queries that specifically target the core plot elements and character relationships required for", "system_prompt_length": 22087, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 2612, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 21928, "response_length": 2612}}

This query aims to retrieve information about who the characters are and why they are acting the way they are, which will provide a deeper understanding of the plot's progression and significance.\n\nPlan 3: The previous queries focused on general plot summaries and character motivations. While these provided some context, they did not specifically extract the core narrative arc of the rescue and escape. The retrieved documents indicate that a significant part of the plot involves Noork rescuing Tholon Sarna and their subsequent escape from the island.

Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.

Lack of Cohesion and Narrative Flow:** The retrieved chunks are disjointed and jump between different plot points without a clear progression. For instance, Iteration 1 jumps from Noork interacting with Rold to an escape scene, and then to Noork's origin story. Iteration 2 similarly mixes his interaction with Sarna, a flashback about Gurn, and a scene with Rold. This fragmented retrieval makes it difficult for the LLM to construct a coherent understanding of the narrative.\n\n**2. Repetitive and Redundant Information:** Multiple chunks cover similar events or introduce the same characters repeatedly. For example, Noork's encounter with Rold and the revelation about the Misty Ones are present in multiple iterations (Iteration 1, Iteration 2). This redundancy wastes valuable context window space and doesn't add new information.\n\n**3. Inconsistent Focus:** The system retrieves snippets that are too granular or focus on minor details, such as descriptions of clothing or brief dialogues. While these might be present in the source text, they don't contribute significantly to the main plot points required to answer a summary-level query. For example, the detailed description of Noork's disguise in Iteration 3 doesn't directly advance the understanding of his mission.\n\n**4. Missing Key Plot Points:** Crucial information for understanding the overall narrative is either absent or buried within less relevant text. For example, while Sarna's captivity and sacrificial fate are mentioned, the specific details of the Temple of Uzdon, the rituals, and the direct plan for rescue are not consistently or clearly presented across the retrieved chunks. The role of \"Gurn\" and his connection to Noork and Sarna is also fragmented.\n\n**To improve retrieval:**\n\n*   **Prioritize thematic relevance:** Instead of simply embedding and retrieving chunks based on keyword similarity, the system should prioritize chunks that contribute to the overarching narrative and character motivations.\n*   **Implement chunk summarization or hierarchical retrieval:** For longer documents, consider a two-stage retrieval process where initial summaries are retrieved, and then more specific chunks are fetched based on the promising summaries.\n*   **Refine the query generation:** The LLM agent refining queries should be guided to generate queries that specifically target the core plot elements and character relationships required for\n\nBased on this single example, provide a detailed critique of how the retrieval plan can be improved.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and make the Fatherland invincible.\" \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies? There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a pretense.\" His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain Dietrich,\" he\n\nScore: 0.3692\non Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed.

And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a good woman—and ugly, my son.\" \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the Misty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals.

For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end. The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely\n\nScore: 0.3625\nI will complete my checking of the gardens.\" Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\" \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I talked with you?\" Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave. The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the eye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of rock gave the illusion of vacancy.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle.

His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and make the Fatherland invincible.\" \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies? There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances.

Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a good woman—and ugly, my son.\" \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the Misty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals.

For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.

Once there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. Noork At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread and grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads vanished. These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like this.\" Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the stains from the dead man's foggy robe. The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it. Ud tasted the\n\nScore: 0.4776\nof long bench-like steps that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple. Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another of their number. He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the jaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose rocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the central raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly worked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish colors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed two beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the wolf-headed shape a female. These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura worshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu! Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two upper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty Ones climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to the slaves and common citizens of the island. As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two short swords rose to bar his way. \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere gruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the most beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the sacrifice is chosen.\" Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside. In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor sharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and shoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward impetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his left. His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony structure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his hands sought the throat of the guard.

It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a good woman—and ugly, my son.\" \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the Misty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island of Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions, are not unkind. \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and\n\nScore: 0.4340\nthe mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white man's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so his robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed body. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the slightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon. The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple, and the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch so well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his mouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful whether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of\n\nScore: 0.4189\nI will complete my checking of the gardens.\" Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\" \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I talked with you?\" Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.

His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and make the Fatherland invincible.\" \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies? There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances.

Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now.

For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm, numbing it so he felt nothing for some time. One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with, Noork\n\nIteration 2 results:\nScore: 0.4914\nawkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. Noork At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread and grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads vanished. These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like this.\" Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the stains from the dead man's foggy robe. The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it. Ud tasted the\n\nScore: 0.4776\nof long bench-like steps that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple. Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another of their number. He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the jaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose rocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the central raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly worked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish colors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed two beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the wolf-headed shape a female. These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura worshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu! Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two upper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty Ones climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to the slaves and common citizens of the island. As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two short swords rose to bar his way. \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere gruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the most beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the sacrifice is chosen.\" Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside. In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor sharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and shoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward impetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his left.

One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white man's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so his robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed body. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the slightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon. The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple, and the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch so well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his mouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful whether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of\n\nScore: 0.4189\nI will complete my checking of the gardens.\" Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\" \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I talked with you?\" Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave. The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the eye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of rock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for windows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at three distinct levels. Noork drifted slowly up the huge series\n\nIteration 3 results:\nScore: 0.5180\nscent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from shoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy. For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end. The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely\n\nScore: 0.5128\ntwo landing stages are further along the beach, opposite the Temple of Uzdon.\" \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\" said Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will have put a safe distance between us.\" Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands of the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the grassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and make the Fatherland invincible.\" \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies? There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a pretense.\" His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain Dietrich,\" he\n\nScore: 0.3986\nsaid as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on Noork's bronzed chest. And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless fingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide belly. He stumbled backward. Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and his men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies. In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him. As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop aside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed. \"Gurn!\" cried Noork. A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother. And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed. Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain Dietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil man when my bird died.\" He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The evil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace with you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\" \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.

Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a good woman—and ugly, my son.\" \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the Misty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals.

It covers the main characters, the central conflict, and the resolution. The ROUGE score of 0.217 indicates a moderate level of overlap with a reference summary, suggesting the response is generally on the right track but could be more precise or comprehensive.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential improvements:\n\n**Strengths of the current response:**\n\n*   **Identifies key characters:** Noork (Dietrich), Sarna, Rold, Von Mark, Gurn, and the Misty Ones are all mentioned.\n*   **Outlines the core conflict:** Noork's amnesia, Sarna's impending sacrifice, and the pursuit of the invisibility secret by Von Mark are central to the plot and are well-represented.\n*   **Describes the setting:** Sekk, Zura's valleys, the Temple of the Skull, and the island in the lake provide context.\n*   **Covers the resolution:** The defeat of Von Mark, the rescue of Sarna, and Dietrich's return to his identity and potential future are included.\n\n**Areas for Improvement and Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Flow and Transition:** While the plot points are there, the transitions between them could be smoother. For instance, the reveal of Von Mark and his connection to Dietrich feels a bit abrupt.\n\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase sentences to create better causal links. For example, instead of \"Noork, with the help of a slave named Rold, infiltrates...\" consider: \"Driven by a growing unease and a desire to protect Sarna, Noork, with the help of a slave named Rold, infiltrates...\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Integrate the revelation about Von Mark more organically. Perhaps: \"As Noork delves deeper into the conspiracy, he encounters Doctor Karl Von Mark, a Nazi scientist obsessed with an invisibility secret. It is during these encounters that Noork begins to recall his past, realizing he is actually Captain Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who had been actively pursuing Von Mark.\"\n\n2.  **Elaboration on \"Invisible Robes\" and \"Invisibility Secret\":** The response mentions invisible robes and an invisibility secret but doesn't fully explain their significance or how they relate to each other. It's implied they are the same, but explicit clarification would strengthen the summary.\n\n    *   **Suggestion:** Clarify the connection early on. \"Noork awakens in Sekk, a land of strange tribes, wearing peculiar invisible robes. He soon learns that these robes are part of a coveted invisibility secret, sought after by the nefarious Nazi scientist, Doctor Karl Von Mark.\"\n\n3.  **Role of the \"Misty Ones\":** The response states they are \"not demons but men\" which is a good clarification. However, their motivation for wanting to sacrifice Sarna could be briefly touched upon if it's significant to the plot's progression beyond just being an obstacle.\n\n    *   **Suggestion:** If their motivation is tied to the invisibility secret or a broader ancient ritual, a brief mention could add depth. If not, the current statement is sufficient.\n\n4.  **Specificity of \"Giant Bird\" and \"Amnesia\":** While these are starting points, adding a touch more detail if available could enhance the summary.\n\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"Noork, a man plagued by amnesia and brought to the mysterious land of Sekk by a giant bird...\" (This is already present, but ensuring it's clearly the *start* of his journey is key).\n\n5.  **Nuance in the Resolution:** The ending is clear but could benefit from a slightly more nuanced description of the triumph.\n\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"With the combined might of Gurn and his Vasad warriors, they confront and ultimately defeat Von Mark and his forces, securing Sarna's safety and allowing Dietrich to reclaim his identity and look forward to a peaceful future with Sarna.\"\n\n6.  **Consistency in Naming:** The response correctly identifies Noork as Captain Stephen Dietrich. Ensure this transition is smooth and consistently referred to.\n\n    *   **Suggestion:** As done in the current response, explicitly stating \"Noork, now remembering his identity, confronts Von Mark\" is good.\n\n**Example of an improved paragraph incorporating some of these suggestions:**\n\n\"The story begins with Noork, a man suffering from amnesia and mysteriously transported to the land of Sekk by a giant bird.

The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love.

Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it. Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from shoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy. For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent\n\nScore: 0.3063\nwill not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island of Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions, are not unkind. \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will complete my checking of the gardens.\" Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\" \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you\n\nScore: 0.2996\nthe wall first and then with Rold helping from below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of them climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the jungle matted ground outside the wall. \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full voice. Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think not,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island to the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we will paddle boldly across the water.\" \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the shore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite the Temple of Uzdon.\" \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\" said Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will have put a safe distance between us.\" Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands of the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the grassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and make the Fatherland invincible.\" \"I do not understand too\n\nScore: 0.2987\nexclaimed at his brown skin. \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet you speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes opened yet wider. \"Who are you?\" \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the wild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for my friend.\" The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall and strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\n\nIMPORTANT: Review the previous decisions above to avoid repeating the same queries.

We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we will paddle boldly across the water.\" \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the shore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite the Temple of Uzdon.\" \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\" said Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will have put a safe distance between us.\" Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands of the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the grassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle.

Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from shoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy. For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large.

There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a pretense.\" His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain Dietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on Noork's bronzed chest. And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless fingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide belly. He stumbled backward. Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and his men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies. In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him. As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop aside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed. \"Gurn!\" cried Noork. A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother. And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed. Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain Dietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil man when my bird died.\" He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The evil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace with you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\" \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.

The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond.

Pools of foul black water dotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two sputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and toward this Noork made his way. He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\" There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white man's legs kept Noork away\n\nIMPORTANT: Review the previous decisions above to avoid repeating the same queries.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends.

Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think not,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island to the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we will paddle boldly across the water.\" \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the shore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite the Temple of Uzdon.\" \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\" said Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will have put a safe distance between us.\" Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands of the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the grassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.

The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it. Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from shoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy. For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large.

There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a pretense.\" His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain Dietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on Noork's bronzed chest. And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless fingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide belly. He stumbled backward. Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and his men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies. In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him. As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop aside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed. \"Gurn!\" cried Noork. A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother. And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed. Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain Dietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil man when my bird died.\" He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The evil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace with you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\" \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.

Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love.

Pools of foul black water dotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two sputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and toward this Noork made his way. He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\" There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack.

One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with, Noork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. Noork At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread and grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads vanished. These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like this.\" Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at\n\nScore: 0.5555\nwill not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island of Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions, are not unkind. \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will complete my checking of the gardens.\" Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves.

It touches upon the key characters (Noork/Dietrich, Sarna, Rold, Von Mark, Gurn), the central conflict (rescuing Sarna, Von Mark's plot, Dietrich's mission), and the resolution.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Identifies Key Characters:** The response successfully names and introduces the main players in the narrative.\n*   **Outlines Major Plot Points:** It covers the initial situation (amnesia, planet Sekk), the inciting incident (Sarna's sacrifice), the rising action (rescue, capture, revelation of Misty Ones), and the climax/resolution (defeat of Von Mark, decision to stay).\n*   **Reveals Key Twists:** The revelation of Noork's true identity as Captain Dietrich and the nature of the \"Misty Ones\" are included.\n*   **Coherent Narrative Flow:** The summary reads logically and follows the progression of events.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **ROUGE Score:** The ROUGE score of 0.18 is quite low, suggesting that while the content might be present, the phrasing, structure, or overlap with potential reference summaries is not optimal. This often indicates a lack of conciseness or a deviation in the way information is presented.\n*   **Slightly Rushed Climax/Resolution:** The transition from defeating Von Mark to deciding to live peacefully feels a bit abrupt. While the mission is complete, the integration into jungle life might benefit from a slightly smoother explanation.\n*   **Potential for Deeper Thematic Connection (Minor):** While the query is about plot, a very subtle hint at the themes of identity (Noork's amnesia and rediscovery) or overcoming adversity could elevate the summary. However, for a plot-focused query, this is less critical.\n*   **Redundancy/Wordiness:** Phrases like \"Noork, a man with amnesia who believes himself to be a 'Misty One' and wears their invisible robes\" could potentially be more concise. The revelation that \"Noork, now remembering his identity as Captain Dietrich, defeats Von Mark\" is good, but the initial description of his belief could be integrated more tightly with his true identity reveal.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to make the summary more concise, impactful, and potentially better aligned with what a high-quality reference summary would look like, aiming to improve the ROUGE score.\n\n1.  **Streamline Introduction and Identity Reveal:**\n    *   **Original:** \"The story follows Noork, a man with amnesia who believes himself to be a \"Misty One\" and wears their invisible robes. He is on the planet Sekk, where his spaceship crashed.\"\n    *   **Improvement:** Combine the amnesia and belief with the later reveal of his true identity more smoothly.\n    *   **Suggested Revision:** \"The story begins with Noork, an amnesiac on the planet Sekk, who believes he is a 'Misty One' and can wield invisible powers. His crashed spaceship lands him in a world where a young girl, Sarna, is to be sacrificed to the god Uzdon.\"\n\n2.  **Conciseness in Plot Progression:**\n    *   **Original:** \"Noork, with the help of a slave named Rold, rescues Sarna from the temple pits. During their escape, they are captured by \"Misty Ones,\" who are revealed to be soldiers led by Doctor Von Mark, a Nazi scientist whom Noork (revealed to be Captain Stephen Dietrich) had been hunting.\"\n    *   **Improvement:** Make the revelation of Von Mark and Dietrich's connection more direct.\n    *   **Suggested Revision:** \"Aided by the slave Rold, Noork rescues Sarna. Their escape is thwarted when they are captured by the 'Misty Ones,' who are revealed to be soldiers under the command of Doctor Von Mark, a Nazi scientist—the very man Captain Stephen Dietrich (Noork's true identity) has been hunting.\"\n\n3.  **Sharpening the \"Misty Ones\" Revelation and Climax:**\n    *   **Original:** \"Von Mark seeks the secret of invisibility to conquer Earth.

Gurn reveals that the Misty Ones can be skinned, implying they are not supernatural beings.

His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and make the Fatherland invincible.\" \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies? There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances.

Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a good woman—and ugly, my son.\" \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the Misty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals.

For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.

He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\" \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I talked with you?\" Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon.

I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer.

Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread and grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads vanished. These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like this.\" Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the stains from the dead man's foggy robe. The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it. Ud tasted the\n\nScore: 0.4776\nof long bench-like steps that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple. Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another of their number. He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the jaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose rocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the central raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly worked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish colors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed two beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the wolf-headed shape a female. These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura worshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu! Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two upper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty Ones climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to the slaves and common citizens of the island. As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two short swords rose to bar his way. \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere gruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the most beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the sacrifice is chosen.\" Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside. In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor sharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and shoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward impetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his left. His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony structure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his hands sought the throat of the guard.

Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a good woman—and ugly, my son.\" \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the Misty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island of Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions, are not unkind. \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and\n\nScore: 0.4340\nthe mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white man's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so his robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed body. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the slightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon. The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple, and the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch so well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his mouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful whether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of\n\nScore: 0.4189\nI will complete my checking of the gardens.\" Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\" \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I talked with you?\" Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave. The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the eye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of rock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for windows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at three distinct levels.

For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end. The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely\n\nScore: 0.5128\ntwo landing stages are further along the beach, opposite the Temple of Uzdon.\" \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\" said Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will have put a safe distance between us.\" Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands of the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the grassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and make the Fatherland invincible.\" \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies? There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a pretense.\" His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain Dietrich,\" he\n\nScore: 0.3986\nsaid as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on Noork's bronzed chest. And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless fingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide belly. He stumbled backward. Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and his men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies. In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him. As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop aside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed. \"Gurn!\" cried Noork. A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother. And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed. Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain Dietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil man when my bird died.\" He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The evil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace with you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\" \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.

He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return.

Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think not,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island to the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we will paddle boldly across the water.\" \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the shore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite the Temple of Uzdon.\" \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\" said Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will have put a safe distance between us.\" Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands of the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the grassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy.

The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle.

The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it. Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from shoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy. For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large.

There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a pretense.\" His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain Dietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on Noork's bronzed chest. And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless fingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide belly. He stumbled backward. Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and his men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies. In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him. As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop aside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed. \"Gurn!\" cried Noork. A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother. And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed. Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain Dietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil man when my bird died.\" He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The evil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace with you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\" \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.

Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond.

Pools of foul black water dotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two sputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and toward this Noork made his way. He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\" There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow.

One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with, Noork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. Noork At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread and grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads vanished. These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like this.\" Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at\n\nScore: 0.5555\nwill not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island of Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions, are not unkind. \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will complete my checking of the gardens.\" Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods.

Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nConversation:  -> The story follows Noork, a man suffering from amnesia who has been brought to Sekk by a giant bird. He discovers he is wearing invisible robes and is in a land with various tribes, including the golden-skinned people of Zura's valleys and the beast-like Vasads. Noork learns that the golden-skinned girl, Sarna, is a slave destined for sacrifice to the god Uzdon by the \"Misty Ones\" who inhabit the Temple of the Skull on an island in a lake.\n\nNoork, with the help of a slave named Rold, infiltrates the Temple of the Skull to rescue Sarna. During his journey, he learns that the Misty Ones are not demons but men. He also encounters Doctor Karl Von Mark, a Nazi scientist who is hunting for an invisibility secret. It is revealed that Noork is actually Captain Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who had been chasing Von Mark.\n\nNoork, now remembering his identity, confronts Von Mark. With the assistance of Gurn, Sarna's brother and leader of the Vasads, and his warriors, they defeat Von Mark and his men. The story concludes with Dietrich (Noork) safe, his enemy defeated, and the prospect of a peaceful life with Sarna in the jungle.\nEvaluation: \n\nContext Summary: \n\nIteration 1 results:\nScore: 0.3700\ntwo landing stages are further along the beach, opposite the Temple of Uzdon.\" \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\" said Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will have put a safe distance between us.\" Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands of the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the grassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and make the Fatherland invincible.\" \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies? There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a pretense.\" His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain Dietrich,\" he\n\nScore: 0.3692\non Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a good woman—and ugly, my son.\" \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the Misty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island of Manak.

For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.

He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\" \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I talked with you?\" Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave. The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the eye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of rock gave the illusion of vacancy.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor.

Once there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. Noork At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread and grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads vanished. These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like this.\" Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the stains from the dead man's foggy robe. The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it. Ud tasted the\n\nScore: 0.4776\nof long bench-like steps that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple. Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another of their number. He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the jaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose rocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the central raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly worked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish colors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed two beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the wolf-headed shape a female. These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura worshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu! Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two upper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty Ones climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to the slaves and common citizens of the island. As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two short swords rose to bar his way. \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere gruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the most beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the sacrifice is chosen.\" Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside. In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor sharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and shoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward impetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his left. His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony structure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his hands sought the throat of the guard.

One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white man's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so his robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed body. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the slightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon. The priest was tiring rapidly, however.

The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.

His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and make the Fatherland invincible.\" \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies? There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances.

And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless fingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide belly. He stumbled backward. Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and his men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies. In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him. As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop aside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed. \"Gurn!\" cried Noork. A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother. And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed. Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain Dietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil man when my bird died.\" He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The evil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace with you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\" \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.

Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white man's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so his robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed body. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the slightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon. The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple, and the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch so well with fat, now served to rob him of breath.

For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon.

He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.

I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....

Pools of foul black water dotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two sputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and toward this Noork made his way. He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\" There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white man's legs kept Noork away\n\nIteration 3 results:\nScore: 0.6054\nthe wall first and then with Rold helping from below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of them climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the jungle matted ground outside the wall. \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full voice. Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think not,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island to the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we will paddle boldly across the water.\" \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the shore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite the Temple of Uzdon.\" \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\" said Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will have put a safe distance between us.\" Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands of the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the grassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear.

One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with, Noork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. Noork At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread and grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads vanished. These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like this.\" Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at\n\nScore: 0.5555\nwill not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island of Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions, are not unkind. \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will complete my checking of the gardens.\" Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nConversation:  -> The story follows Noork, a man with amnesia who believes himself to be a \"Misty One\" and wears their invisible robes. He is on the planet Sekk, where his spaceship crashed. He learns of a girl named Sarna, the daughter of a merchant, who is to be sacrificed to a god named Uzdon.\n\nNoork, with the help of a slave named Rold, rescues Sarna from the temple pits. During their escape, they are captured by \"Misty Ones,\" who are revealed to be soldiers led by Doctor Von Mark, a Nazi scientist whom Noork (revealed to be Captain Stephen Dietrich) had been hunting. Von Mark seeks the secret of invisibility to conquer Earth.\n\nNoork is freed by Gurn, a golden-skinned warrior and Sarna's brother, along with his Vasad warriors, who have been hunting the Misty Ones. Gurn reveals that the Misty Ones can be skinned, implying they are not supernatural beings. Noork, now remembering his identity as Captain Dietrich, defeats Von Mark. The story concludes with Noork deciding to live peacefully with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle, his mission to hunt Von Mark complete and his native valley safe.\nEvaluation: \n\nBased on this single example, provide a detailed critique of how the retrieved content can be improved.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.

He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\" \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I talked with you?\" Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave. The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the eye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of rock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for windows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at three distinct levels.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm, numbing it so he felt nothing for some time. One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with, Noork\n\nIteration 2 results:\nScore: 0.4914\nawkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. Noork At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread and grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads vanished. These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like this.\" Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the stains from the dead man's foggy robe. The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it. Ud tasted the\n\nScore: 0.4776\nof long bench-like steps that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple. Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another of their number. He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the jaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose rocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the central raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly worked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish colors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed two beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the wolf-headed shape a female. These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura worshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu! Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two upper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty Ones climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to the slaves and common citizens of the island. As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two short swords rose to bar his way. \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere gruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the most beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the sacrifice is chosen.\" Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside. In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor sharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and shoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward impetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his left. His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony structure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his hands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning gurgled\n\nScore: 0.4621\non Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a good woman—and ugly, my son.\" \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the Misty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island of Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions, are not unkind. \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and\n\nScore: 0.4340\nthe mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed.

One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white man's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so his robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed body. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the slightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon. The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple, and the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch so well with fat, now served to rob him of breath.

For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon.

His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and make the Fatherland invincible.\" \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies? There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances.

And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless fingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide belly. He stumbled backward. Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and his men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies. In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him. As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop aside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed. \"Gurn!\" cried Noork. A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother. And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed. Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name.

You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white man's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so his robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed body. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the slightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon. The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple, and the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch so well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his mouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful whether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of\n\n--- Context Separator ---\n\n\n\nIteration 1 results:\nScore: 0.3113\nhim hurtling spaceward in the second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end. The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a good woman—and ugly, my son.\" \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall.

Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it. Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from shoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy. For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent\n\nScore: 0.3063\nwill not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island of Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions, are not unkind. \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will complete my checking of the gardens.\" Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return.

A moment later saw the three of them climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the jungle matted ground outside the wall. \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full voice. Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think not,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island to the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we will paddle boldly across the water.\" \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the shore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite the Temple of Uzdon.\" \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\" said Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will have put a safe distance between us.\" Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands of the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the grassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed.

The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle.

His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a pretense.\" His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain Dietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on Noork's bronzed chest. And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless fingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide belly. He stumbled backward. Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and his men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies. In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him. As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop aside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed. \"Gurn!\" cried Noork. A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother. And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed.

Pools of foul black water dotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two sputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and toward this Noork made his way. He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\" There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow.

He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a good woman—and ugly, my son.\" \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the Misty Ones\n\nScore: 0.5577\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time. One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with, Noork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. Noork At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread and grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads vanished. These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like this.\" Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at\n\nScore: 0.5555\nwill not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island of Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions, are not unkind. \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will complete my checking of the gardens.\" Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\" \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you\n\nScore: 0.5507\nexclaimed at his brown skin. \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet you speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes opened yet wider. \"Who are you?\" \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the wild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for my friend.\" The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall and strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle.

However, there are areas for improvement to enhance relevance and coherence.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Character and Plot Identification:** The context successfully identifies major characters like Noork (Captain Dietrich), Sarna, Rold, Gurn, and Doctor Von Mark, along with crucial plot elements such as the amnesia, the Misty Ones, the sacrifice to Uzdon, the rescue mission, and the confrontation with Von Mark.\n*   **Setting Establishment:** Information about Sekk, the jungle environment, and the Temple of the Skull provides a good sense of place.\n*   **Key Revelations:** The context captures significant plot turns like Noork discovering he's not a Misty One, his true identity as Captain Dietrich, and Von Mark's pursuit of invisibility.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Redundancy and Repetition:** Several retrieved chunks contain very similar information, especially regarding Noork's arrival on Sekk, his amnesia, and his initial encounters with the world. For instance, multiple chunks mention \"New York,\" the \"battered wrist watch,\" and the \"giant bird.\" This repetition dilutes the impact and efficiency of the retrieved context.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Prioritize unique plot points and character developments. Consolidate similar information to avoid redundancy.\n\n2.  **Inconsistent Narrative Flow:** While individual chunks contain relevant details, their arrangement can sometimes disrupt the narrative flow. For example, the revelation of Noork being Captain Dietrich and his history with Von Mark appears in multiple scattered snippets rather than being presented in a more sequential manner.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Re-rank or re-cluster the retrieved documents to ensure a more logical progression of the story, especially for critical plot revelations and character arcs.\n\n3.  **Focus on Action vs. Exposition:** Some retrieved contexts heavily focus on action sequences (e.g., fighting priests, escaping guards) which are important but can sometimes overshadow the exposition that drives the narrative forward (e.g., details about the societal structure, the motivations of different factions).\n    *   **Suggestion:** Ensure a balance between action and exposition.
