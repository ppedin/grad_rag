However, the ROUGE score of 0.0 indicates that there is a complete lack of overlap with the reference or expected response. This could be due to several reasons that can be addressed in the following suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Specificity and Context**: The response lacks specific details that directly relate to the original story in question. It is essential to draw from the actual plot of the story being referenced. If this response is meant to summarize a specific work, including characters' names, key events, and explicit references to the beginning, climax, and resolution of the plot will make it more relevant.\n\n2. **Clarity and Structure**: While the summary provides an overall view of the story, it could be structured more clearly. Starting with a brief introduction of the setting or initial situation, followed by the central conflict or problem, the rising action, climax, and resolution would create a more cohesive narrative flow.\n\n3. **Reference Naming**: The mention of 'Tholon Sarna' and 'golden girl' is vague without context. More familiar or explicit descriptions of these characters and their roles would enhance reader understanding and connection.\n\n4. **Avoid Ambiguity**: Phrases like \"unseen evil beings\" and \"dark forces\" are too generic. More specific descriptions of whom or what these forces are, their motives, and relationships with central characters will eliminate ambiguity and provide a richer picture.\n\n5. **Engagement**: While the response outlines the adventure and elements of conflict, incorporating a sense of urgency or emotional stakes can enhance engagement. Describing the motivations of the characters or the implications of their missions can create a more compelling synopsis.\n\n6. **Terminology and Consistency**: Make sure to maintain consistency with terminologies used in the original story. If \"Axis criminal\" is specific to the story, ensure clarity on what it means. Such terminologies should be explained so that anyone reading the synopsis would understand their significance.\n\n7. **Use of Quotes**: If appropriate, integrating notable lines or references from the text can enhance authority and connection to the original source material.\n\nBy addressing these factors, the generated response would be more aligned with the query and likely yield a better ROUGE score, indicating greater relevance and coherence to the actual plot being discussed.", "system_prompt_length": 1060, "user_prompt_length": 65, "response_length": 2581, "metadata": {"rouge_score": 0.0, "original_query_length": 30, "generated_answer_length": 768, "evaluation_length": 2581}}
