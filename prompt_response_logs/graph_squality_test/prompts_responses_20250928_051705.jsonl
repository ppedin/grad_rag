The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge.

The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man with a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more. He sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a half-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps. In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging out, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle on the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion of the upper temple was muted to a murmur.

The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the eye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of rock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for windows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at three distinct levels. Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.

Now he saw the central raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly worked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish colors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed two beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the wolf-headed shape a female. These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura worshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu! Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two upper levels.

And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large.

Finally, triplets were formed to represent the core subject-predicate-object relationships extracted from the text. The reasoning for identifying entities like 'Ud', 'Noork', 'Gurn', and 'Sarna' is based on them being named characters performing actions or being acted upon. 'Demons' and 'Misty Ones' are identified as concepts representing supernatural or dangerous beings whose characteristics are described. 'Lake of Uzdon' and the implied 'Jungle' are identified as locations. 'Zuran' is identified as a concept due to its mention as a scent detected by Ud, implying its presence but without further definition in this snippet. Relationships like 'Ud hunts near Lake of Uzdon' are directly supported by the dialogue. The connection between Noork and Gurn is established through Noork's instructions and desire to save Gurn. The relationship between Gurn and Sarna is inferred from 'his father's woman woman, called Sarna', indicating Sarna's familial connection to Gurn's father, which by extension relates to Gurn.

Relationships were established based on verbs indicating actions (e.g., 'avoid', 'trailed', 'stole', 'take', 'visit', 'vanished') or prepositions indicating association ('from'). For each relationship, I identified the source entity, target entity, the type of relationship, a brief description explaining the connection, and the specific textual evidence supporting it. Finally, I summarized these relationships into subject-predicate-object triplets.

It doesn't account for situations where the information is related but not directly answering, or where it's of a different format (like graph data vs. narrative text).\n\n**Suggestions for Prompt Improvement:**\n\nTo address these issues and align with the feedback, the prompt should be significantly enhanced to:\n\n1.  **Define a Helpful Assistant Persona:** Instruct the LLM to act as a helpful and understanding assistant.\n2.  **Provide Explicit Instructions for Handling Insufficient Information:**\n    *   **Acknowledge Limitation Clearly but Politely:** Similar to the current response, but framed within the assistant persona.\n    *   **Explain *Why* (in user-friendly terms):** Guide the LLM to explain that the retrieved information (e.g., graph data) doesn't contain narrative plot details, using analogies if possible.\n    *   **Offer Concrete Next Steps/Alternatives:** This is the most critical addition. The prompt should instruct the LLM to suggest:\n        *   Searching for a plot summary using different methods.\n        *   Providing information about characters/relationships if that's of interest.\n        *   Asking the user if they'd like to refine their search.\n3.  **Emphasize User-Centricity:** Explicitly state that the goal is not just to answer, but to assist the user in achieving their objective, even if it requires alternative approaches.\n4.  **Guide Explanation of Retrieved Context:** If the retrieved context is a graph, the prompt should prompt the LLM to explain this simply before stating its limitations regarding narrative.\n\nBy incorporating these points, the prompt can be transformed from a simple data-mapping instruction to one that fosters a more interactive, helpful, and user-friendly RAG system.\n\nBased on this critique, generate a new system prompt that will be used to instruct the LLM how to better generate answers from retrieved graph information. The system prompt should incorporate the feedback to improve answer quality, relevance, and coherence.\n\nProvide only the optimized system prompt without additional commentary.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

The `search_nodes_by_keyword` function is the most appropriate to find nodes that might contain information about the plot. I will search for the keyword 'plot'.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nThe retrieval plan exhibits significant shortcomings, primarily stemming from a failure to construct a meaningful graph that can answer the user's query about the story's plot.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Initial Node Listing is Insufficient:** Iteration 1 successfully identifies a large number of potential entities (characters), but crucially, it fails to extract any relationships or attributes between them. The repeated \"connections... have not been explored yet\" indicates a basic entity extraction rather than graph building. A list of names, however comprehensive, does not form a narrative or provide plot details.\n\n2.  **Graph Construction Failure:** Iterations 2 and 3, resulting in an \"empty graph,\" demonstrate a catastrophic failure in graph generation or merging. If Iteration 1 identified nodes, subsequent steps should have attempted to connect them based on the input text. This suggests a fundamental flaw in the LLM's ability to extract relational information or the graph merging process.\n\n3.  **Inability to Address the Query:** The user's query \"What is the plot of the story?\" requires understanding sequences of events, character interactions, and causal links. The retrieved content, being either an unlinked list of entities or an empty graph, is entirely incapable of supporting such an answer. The system is not extracting or representing the necessary narrative structure.\n\n4.  **Ineffective Agent Exploration:** The agent's exploration plan (Move 1, Move 2, Move 3) is superficial. Move 1 aims to find characters, which is done, but the plan doesn't outline *how* to use these characters to understand the plot. Move 3's keyword search for 'plot' is a reasonable *strategy* but failed to yield results because the underlying graph structure wasn't built to contain plot information. The agent needs to actively query relationships between identified entities.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relation Extraction:** The core issue is the lack of relation extraction. The LLM responsible for graph generation per chunk must be prompted to identify and extract relationships (e.g., \"Character A *influences* Character B,\" \"Event X *leads to* Event Y,\" \"Character C *possesses* Object Z\") alongside entities.\n\n2.  **Robust Graph Merging:** Ensure the graph merging process effectively combines information from different chunks. If nodes are identified in multiple chunks, their relationships should be consolidated. The empty graph result points to a breakdown here.\n\n3.  **Agent-Driven Exploration:** The agent's exploration moves should be more directed. After identifying key entities (e.g., central characters), the agent should query for their direct and indirect relationships, actions, and motivations. For example, instead of just noting \"connections not explored,\" it should actively query: \"What is the relationship between Captain Dietrich and the girl?\" or \"What actions did Doctor Von Mark take?\"\n\n4.  **Iterative Graph Enrichment:** If initial graph extraction is sparse, the agent should employ techniques like centrality analysis, community detection, or pathfinding to enrich the graph and infer plot elements. The goal should be to build a graph that *represents* the story's dynamics, not just a collection of isolated nodes.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique that will be used to improve the retrieval planning prompt.  \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

While important, simply listing characters or locations does not constitute understanding a plot. The plans consistently fail to incorporate steps that explore the *relationships* between these entities. The graph, as described, is rich with relationship types that are crucial for narrative understanding (e.g., \"interacts with,\" \"travels to,\" \"attacked,\" \"killed\"), yet these are largely ignored.\n\n2.  **Ineffective Search Strategy for \"Plot\":** The repeated use of `search_nodes_by_keyword('plot')` is a reactive and likely ineffective strategy. A plot is not typically a single node labeled \"plot.\" Instead, it's an emergent property of character actions, events, and their connections. The agent should be *constructing* an understanding of the plot through relational exploration, not searching for a literal keyword.\n\n3.  **Lack of Depth in Exploration:** The plans do not demonstrate a strategic approach to traversing the graph to piece together a narrative. For instance, once \"Person\" nodes are identified, the logical next step would be to `get_neighbors` for key characters to understand their immediate connections and actions. The plans lack this sequential, deductive reasoning.\n\n4.  **Underutilization of Graph Properties:** The graph description highlights various entity and relationship types. The retrieval plans do not show any attempt to leverage these specific types to infer plot points. For example, searching for `travels to` relationships could reveal journey arcs, while `attacked` or `killed` relationships signal conflict and turning points.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relational Exploration:** The prompt needs to guide the agent to actively explore relationships between identified entities. Encourage using `get_neighbors` on key entities and then examining the *types* of relationships to infer plot elements.\n2.  **Develop Narrative-Driven Strategies:** Instead of searching for \"plot,\" the agent should be prompted to identify key actors, their motivations (if discernible from relationship types like \"desire,\" \"aims to save\"), and the sequence of their interactions or significant events.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement of Understanding:** Encourage the agent to use information from previous steps. If a character is identified, the next step should be to explore their connections, not just list more entities.\n4.  **Leverage Specific Relationship Types:** Prompt the agent to consider relationship types that are indicative of plot progression (e.g., actions, conflicts, travel, motivations).

Your goal is to construct a retrieval plan that effectively explores a knowledge graph to answer user queries. You must go beyond superficial entity extraction and focus on understanding the relational structure of the graph to construct a coherent answer.\n\n**Core Principles for Retrieval Planning:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relational Exploration:** When you identify key entities (nodes), your primary next step should be to explore their *relationships* (edges) using `get_neighbors(node_id, relationship_types=None)`. Do not simply extract more entities without understanding their connections.\n\n2.  **Infer Concepts from Relationships:** Abstract concepts like \"plot,\" \"conflict,\" \"motivation,\" or \"journey\" are not typically found as direct node labels. You must infer these by analyzing the *types* of relationships between entities. For example:\n    *   `travels to` relationships can indicate a journey.\n    *   `attacked`, `killed`, `betrayed` relationships signal conflict and turning points.\n    *   `interacts with`, `helps`, `hinders` relationships reveal character dynamics and plot progression.\n    *   If motivation is present, look for relationships like `desires`, `aims to achieve`, `wants to save`.\n\n3.  **Strategic Graph Traversal:** Plan your exploration sequentially. After identifying initial entities, trace their connections to understand their roles and actions within the narrative or topic. Use the information gathered at each step to inform the next.\n\n4.  **Avoid Literal Keyword Searches for Abstract Concepts:** Do not use `search_nodes_by_keyword('plot')` or similar broad, literal searches for abstract narrative elements. Instead, *construct* an understanding of the plot by piecing together events, character actions, and their causal or sequential relationships.\n\n5.  **Leverage Specific Node and Relationship Types:** Pay close attention to the `node_types` and `relationship_types` available in the graph schema. Use these specific labels to guide your search and exploration for relevant information that directly contributes to answering the query.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nGiven a user query, generate a sequence of retrieval actions. Each action should be a call to one of the following functions:\n*   `search_nodes_by_keyword(keyword: str, limit: int = 10)`: Use this for specific, concrete entities or well-defined concepts that are likely to be node labels or properties.\n*   `get_neighbors(node_id: str, relationship_types: Optional[List[str]] = None, limit: int = 10)`: **This is your primary tool for understanding relationships and plot.** Use this after identifying relevant nodes.\n*   `get_node_details(node_id: str)`: Use this to retrieve properties of a specific node when its ID is known.\n\nYour plan should be a Python list of function calls, ensuring that each step logically builds upon the previous one to gather information necessary to answer the query by understanding the graph's relational structure.

Searching for nodes of type 'Person' will give us a list of all characters in the story, which is a good starting point for uncovering the plot.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nThe retrieval plan exhibits significant shortcomings, primarily stemming from a failure to construct a meaningful graph that can answer the user's query about the story's plot.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Initial Node Listing is Insufficient:** Iteration 1 successfully identifies a large number of potential entities (characters), but crucially, it fails to extract any relationships or attributes between them. The repeated \"connections... have not been explored yet\" indicates a basic entity extraction rather than graph building. A list of names, however comprehensive, does not form a narrative or provide plot details.\n\n2.  **Graph Construction Failure:** Iterations 2 and 3, resulting in an \"empty graph,\" demonstrate a catastrophic failure in graph generation or merging. If Iteration 1 identified nodes, subsequent steps should have attempted to connect them based on the input text. This suggests a fundamental flaw in the LLM's ability to extract relational information or the graph merging process.\n\n3.  **Inability to Address the Query:** The user's query \"What is the plot of the story?\" requires understanding sequences of events, character interactions, and causal links. The retrieved content, being either an unlinked list of entities or an empty graph, is entirely incapable of supporting such an answer. The system is not extracting or representing the necessary narrative structure.\n\n4.  **Ineffective Agent Exploration:** The agent's exploration plan (Move 1, Move 2, Move 3) is superficial. Move 1 aims to find characters, which is done, but the plan doesn't outline *how* to use these characters to understand the plot. Move 3's keyword search for 'plot' is a reasonable *strategy* but failed to yield results because the underlying graph structure wasn't built to contain plot information. The agent needs to actively query relationships between identified entities.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relation Extraction:** The core issue is the lack of relation extraction. The LLM responsible for graph generation per chunk must be prompted to identify and extract relationships (e.g., \"Character A *influences* Character B,\" \"Event X *leads to* Event Y,\" \"Character C *possesses* Object Z\") alongside entities.\n\n2.  **Robust Graph Merging:** Ensure the graph merging process effectively combines information from different chunks. If nodes are identified in multiple chunks, their relationships should be consolidated. The empty graph result points to a breakdown here.\n\n3.  **Agent-Driven Exploration:** The agent's exploration moves should be more directed. After identifying key entities (e.g., central characters), the agent should query for their direct and indirect relationships, actions, and motivations. For example, instead of just noting \"connections not explored,\" it should actively query: \"What is the relationship between Captain Dietrich and the girl?\" or \"What actions did Doctor Von Mark take?\"\n\n4.  **Iterative Graph Enrichment:** If initial graph extraction is sparse, the agent should employ techniques like centrality analysis, community detection, or pathfinding to enrich the graph and infer plot elements. The goal should be to build a graph that *represents* the story's dynamics, not just a collection of isolated nodes.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the graph can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing. Focus on the most critical points and be concise.", "user_prompt": "Please provide your critique and feedback.", "llm_response": "The current graph has a good variety of entity types and relationship types, which is a positive start for representing complex information. However, there are several areas where the graph construction and subsequent retrieval planning could be significantly improved to better answer queries like \"What is the plot of the story?\".\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Granularity in Plot Elements:** While the graph contains many entities and relationships, it appears to be at a high level and may not capture the sequential nature or causal links required to describe a plot. For instance, a plot involves a sequence of events, character motivations, and their consequences. The current graph structure might represent characters and locations, but the relationships might not explicitly detail *actions* or *events* that form the narrative progression. A large number of relationship types are present, but it's unclear if these are sufficiently descriptive of plot progression.\n\n2.  **Potential for Over-Specificity and Noise:** With 214 relationships, many of which appear only once (e.g., \"acknowledgement,\" \"affection,\" \"aims to save\"), the graph might contain a lot of noise. While these can be informative, if the primary goal is to understand the plot, relationships that describe direct actions, conflicts, goals, and outcomes would be more critical. A high number of infrequent relationships might dilute the significance of more plot-relevant connections.\n\n3.  **Ambiguity in Relationship Definitions:** Some relationship types are quite abstract or could overlap (e.g., \"associated with\" vs. \"in\" vs. \"located in,\" or multiple variations of \"attacked\"). Clarifying or consolidating these could lead to a more robust and interpretable graph. For example, \"associated with\" is very broad and doesn't specify the nature of the association, which is crucial for plot understanding.\n\n4.  **Retrieval Plan's Limited Scope:** The retrieval plan focuses solely on identifying \"Person\" nodes. While identifying characters is a necessary first step, it's insufficient for understanding the plot. The plan does not outline how to explore the *relationships* between these characters or how to uncover the events and actions that constitute the narrative. The agent needs to actively query for actions, motivations, and consequences.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Relationships:** When extracting relationships, prioritize those that describe actions, cause-and-effect, intentions, conflicts, and resolutions. For example, relationships like \"character X *travels to* location Y,\" \"character X *attacks* character Y,\" \"character X *wants to achieve* goal Z,\" or \"event A *causes* event B\" are more critical for plot understanding than more abstract associations. Consider creating or identifying more specific relationship types that capture these narrative elements.\n\n2.  **Focus on Temporal and Causal Links:** The graph construction should aim to represent the temporal flow of events and causal dependencies. If possible, relationships could be augmented with timestamps or sequence information, or specific relationship types could be designed to indicate temporal order or causality.\n\n3.  **Develop More Sophisticated Exploration Strategies:** The retrieval plan should move beyond simply listing entities. After identifying key characters, the agent should be prompted to explore their interactions, the objects they use, the locations they visit, and the outcomes of their actions. This could involve:\n    *   Querying for outgoing/incoming relationships of key entities.\n    *   Performing pathfinding to understand connections between characters or events.\n    *   Identifying nodes representing specific events and their participants.\n\n4.  **Refine Relationship Granularity and Hierarchy:** Consider grouping similar relationship types or introducing a hierarchy. For instance, a broad \"interacts with\" could be broken down into more specific types like \"helps,\" \"hinders,\" \"fights,\" \"communicates with,\" etc., which are more informative for plot details. Consolidating redundant or overly similar relationships (e.g., variations of \"attacked\" or \"located in\") would also improve clarity.", "system_prompt_length": 10679, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 4232, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 10520, "enhanced_prompt_length": 10679, "response_length": 4232}}

Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions.

However, there are several areas where the graph construction and subsequent retrieval planning could be significantly improved to better answer queries like \"What is the plot of the story?\".\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Granularity in Plot Elements:** While the graph contains many entities and relationships, it appears to be at a high level and may not capture the sequential nature or causal links required to describe a plot. For instance, a plot involves a sequence of events, character motivations, and their consequences. The current graph structure might represent characters and locations, but the relationships might not explicitly detail *actions* or *events* that form the narrative progression. A large number of relationship types are present, but it's unclear if these are sufficiently descriptive of plot progression.\n\n2.  **Potential for Over-Specificity and Noise:** With 214 relationships, many of which appear only once (e.g., \"acknowledgement,\" \"affection,\" \"aims to save\"), the graph might contain a lot of noise. While these can be informative, if the primary goal is to understand the plot, relationships that describe direct actions, conflicts, goals, and outcomes would be more critical. A high number of infrequent relationships might dilute the significance of more plot-relevant connections.\n\n3.  **Ambiguity in Relationship Definitions:** Some relationship types are quite abstract or could overlap (e.g., \"associated with\" vs. \"in\" vs. \"located in,\" or multiple variations of \"attacked\"). Clarifying or consolidating these could lead to a more robust and interpretable graph. For example, \"associated with\" is very broad and doesn't specify the nature of the association, which is crucial for plot understanding.\n\n4.  **Retrieval Plan's Limited Scope:** The retrieval plan focuses solely on identifying \"Person\" nodes. While identifying characters is a necessary first step, it's insufficient for understanding the plot. The plan does not outline how to explore the *relationships* between these characters or how to uncover the events and actions that constitute the narrative. The agent needs to actively query for actions, motivations, and consequences.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Relationships:** When extracting relationships, prioritize those that describe actions, cause-and-effect, intentions, conflicts, and resolutions. For example, relationships like \"character X *travels to* location Y,\" \"character X *attacks* character Y,\" \"character X *wants to achieve* goal Z,\" or \"event A *causes* event B\" are more critical for plot understanding than more abstract associations. Consider creating or identifying more specific relationship types that capture these narrative elements.\n\n2.  **Focus on Temporal and Causal Links:** The graph construction should aim to represent the temporal flow of events and causal dependencies. If possible, relationships could be augmented with timestamps or sequence information, or specific relationship types could be designed to indicate temporal order or causality.\n\n3.  **Develop More Sophisticated Exploration Strategies:** The retrieval plan should move beyond simply listing entities. After identifying key characters, the agent should be prompted to explore their interactions, the objects they use, the locations they visit, and the outcomes of their actions. This could involve:\n    *   Querying for outgoing/incoming relationships of key entities.\n    *   Performing pathfinding to understand connections between characters or events.\n    *   Identifying nodes representing specific events and their participants.\n\n4.  **Refine Relationship Granularity and Hierarchy:** Consider grouping similar relationship types or introducing a hierarchy. For instance, a broad \"interacts with\" could be broken down into more specific types like \"helps,\" \"hinders,\" \"fights,\" \"communicates with,\" etc., which are more informative for plot details. Consolidating redundant or overly similar relationships (e.g., variations of \"attacked\" or \"located in\") would also improve clarity.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the chunk size can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

For example, a crucial dialogue between characters, a detailed description of an important event, or the setup and resolution of a conflict might be split across multiple chunks. This fragmentation can lead to:\n    *   **Incomplete Information per Chunk:** When an LLM extracts a graph from a 200-word chunk, it may only see a portion of a larger event or interaction. This can result in incomplete or misleading entities and relationships being extracted. For instance, a character's motivation might be stated in one chunk, while the action resulting from that motivation is in another.\n    *   **Loss of Context:** The relationships extracted might lack the necessary context to understand their significance. A character performing an action might be identified, but the reason *why* they are performing it, or the immediate consequence, might be absent due to being in a different chunk. This hinders the extraction of causal and temporal links.\n\n2.  **Increased Graph Sparsity and Noise for Plot:** While a larger chunk size can sometimes introduce noise, a very small chunk size like 200 is more likely to lead to a graph that is *too sparse* in terms of meaningful plot progression.\n    *   **Over-fragmented Relationships:** Relationships that span across chunk boundaries will be lost or incompletely represented. For example, a \"travels to\" relationship might be partially captured, or the full journey and its purpose might be obscured.\n    *   **Dilution of Important Entities/Relationships:** If key plot drivers are split, the resulting nodes and edges might appear less connected or significant than they truly are in the narrative.

A larger chunk size (e.g., 400-600 words, or even larger depending on testing) would increase the likelihood that a single, important narrative event, character interaction, or plot development is contained within a single chunk.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties.

He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the priest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the new robe. \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's curious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision slot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the girl's hand. \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is given.\" Without incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the rows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field, his crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not watching when Rold abruptly faded from view. Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of the vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had no wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens of the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the escape of the slaves. They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging as he had left it. He climbed\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread and grew.

Noork's actions and immediate experiences were also detailed: he sought safety in a 'jungle monarch' tree, experienced pain and then gained strength in his arm, and actively attacked the 'Misty Ones' by throwing 'juicy fruit' at them. This led to the creation of new relationships such as 'ORIGINATES_FROM', 'TARGETS', 'ATTACKS', 'INSTILLED FEAR IN', 'CLIMBS', 'COLLECTS', 'ASSOCIATED WITH', 'PERCHED IN', 'USES FOR SAFETY', 'BLENDED WITH', 'STAINS', 'EXPERIENCES PAIN IN', 'GAINS', and 'OBSERVES'.

The 'Misty Ones' entity was created with properties detailing their description and origin. The 'Lake of Uzdon' was added as a location, and 'juicy fruit' as an object with its properties of being sticky and staining.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed. Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain Dietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil man when my bird died.\" He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The evil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace with you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\" \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.

Relationships were established to describe interactions such as Tholon Sarna creeping closer to Noork, Gurn commanding Vasads who concealed beast men, Rold expressing fear, Ud delivering a message to Gurn, Gurn trapping Misty Ones and addressing Von Mark, Gurn considering Noork a friend, Noork warning about priests of Uzdon who perceive Misty Ones as visible, Noork acquiring the vision shield, Noork revealing himself as Captain Dietrich, Captain Dietrich hailing from America, hunting and defeating an evil man, losing a bird, confirming America's safety, embracing Tholon Sarna, and desiring to live with Gurn and Tholon Sarna. Additionally, Tholon Sarna's acknowledgement of Noork and her sibling relationship with Gurn were noted. Properties were updated for existing entities where new information was found, such as Noork's dual identity, Gurn's loyalty, Von Mark's dying status, Uzdon's deity type, America's location type, Misty Ones' conceptual nature, and the vision shield's fallen status.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

Not forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged cliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest, and the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had confirmed that belief. For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of the cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour the great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death of the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the words that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated them aloud. \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\" The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going back to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow and stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle giant. Noork grinned. \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her. \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you hunter or escaped slave?\" \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted narl last night when it attacked you.\" Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never far from the hilt of her hunting dagger. Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder of limbs to her side.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest. This amulet allowed her to control time, which she used to prevent the dragon from attacking the village.\"\n\n*   **Entities:** Alice (Character), Magical Amulet (Object), Forbidden Forest (Location), Time (Concept), Dragon (Character), Village (Location).\n*   **Properties:**\n    *   (Alice, motivation, prevent dragon attack)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, ability, control time)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, state, found)\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   (Alice, FINDS, Magical Amulet)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, LOCATED_IN, Forbidden Forest)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, GRANTS_ABILITY, Alice) # Or (Alice, CONTROLS, Time)\n    *   (Alice, USES, Magical Amulet)\n    *   (Alice, PREVENTS, Dragon Attack) # Or (Alice, PREVENTS_ATTACK_BY(Dragon, Village))\n    *   (Dragon, ATTACKS, Village)\n\nBegin graph construction for the provided text.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water dotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two sputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and toward this Noork made his way. He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\" There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple. Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another of their number.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it. Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from shoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy. For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions.

Several relationships were identified, such as Noork wearing the 'invisible robes of a Misty One', being 'located in' a 'Cultivated Field', finding and climbing a 'Solitary Tree', and entering 'Sleep'. The text also establishes Sarna as the 'daughter of Tholon Dist' and 'chosen for sacrifice to Uzdon' by the 'Priests of Uzdon'. The 'Fields of the Misty Ones' are identified as belonging to the 'Misty Ones'. Noork 'observes' 'Golden-skinned Slaves', and the 'Younger Slave' expresses a desire to 'mate with a beautiful woman', specifically 'Tholon Sarna'. An 'Old Man' gives advice on choosing a wife, and a 'Slave' expresses intent to escape 'over the wall' and 'fears' the 'Misty Ones'. Entity properties were updated to include descriptions and statuses derived from the text, such as the 'Cultivated Field' being a place where Noork wakes up, the 'Skull' being 'illumined by torches and bonfires', and the general 'Slave' category encompassing multiple individuals with specific roles and fears. The relationship 'WEARS' was used for Noork's robes, 'LOCATED_IN' for geographical placements, 'FINDS' and 'CLIMBS' for Noork's actions, 'ENTERS' for his sleep state, 'DAUGHTER OF' and 'HAS_FATHER' for familial ties, 'BELONGS TO' for association, 'OBSERVES' for Noork's perception, 'SERVE' for the priests' role, 'CHOSEN FOR SACRIFICE TO' and 'CHOOSES' for the sacrificial context, 'PREFERRED BY' for the priests' selection criteria, 'WISHES TO MATE WITH' and 'IS CONSIDERED BY' for desires and perceptions, 'ADVISES TO CHOOSE' for the old man's counsel, 'INTENDS TO GO OVER' for the slave's escape plan, and 'FEARS' for the slave's apprehension.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 4275, "user_prompt_length": 8632, "response_length": 12757, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 1381, "existing_graph_summary_length": 5954, "mode": "refinement"}}

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions.

He has told me the reason.

The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue.

He is also the chief of the Vasads.\\n    *   **Sarna:** Character with violet, oddly slanting eyes, wearing sandals.\\n    *   **Vasad:** A group inhabiting the jungle, described as 'wild'.\\n    *   **Grath:** A walled city, from which Gurn is exiled.\\n    *   **Zuran:** A captured group from other valleys.\\n    *   **language of the true men:** A concept representing a language spoken by Noork.\\n    *   **reason for exile:** A concept detailing why Gurn was exiled (opposition to enslaving Zurans).\\n\\n2.  **New Relationships Created:**\\n    *   Connections between Noork, Gurn, and the Vasads (`DWELLS_AMONG`, `FRIEND_OF`, `CHIEF_OF`).\\n    *   Gurn's status as an exile from Grath and being called a traitor (`EXILE_FROM`, `CALL_TRAITOR`).\\n    *   Sarna's familial connection and her brother's actions (`HAS_BROTHER`, `OPPOSED_SLAVERY_OF`).\\n    *   Noork's and Sarna's knowledge of the reason for exile (`UNDERSTANDS`, `KNOWS`).\\n    *   Noork's linguistic ability (`SPEAKS`).\\n    *   Interactions and attractions between Noork and Sarna (`ADMIRES`, `EXPRESSES_DISPLEASURE_WITH_TONGUE`, `ATTRACTED_TO`, `IS_ATTRACTIVE_TO`, `INTERACTS_WITH`).\\n    *   Implied past presence of Noork in Grath (`WAS_IN`).\\n\\n3.  **Entity Property Updates:**\\n    *   Updated Sarna with eye color and shape.\\n    *   Updated Gurn with exile and traitor information.\\n    *   Updated Noork with skin color, hair color, and specific dwelling details.\\n\\nThe existing graph was enhanced by adding these specific details and connections, providing a richer narrative understanding of the characters and their circumstances within the story.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 4275, "user_prompt_length": 8617, "response_length": 12110, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 1366, "existing_graph_summary_length": 5954, "mode": "refinement"}}

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest. This amulet allowed her to control time, which she used to prevent the dragon from attacking the village.\"\n\n*   **Entities:** Alice (Character), Magical Amulet (Object), Forbidden Forest (Location), Time (Concept), Dragon (Character), Village (Location).\n*   **Properties:**\n    *   (Alice, motivation, prevent dragon attack)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, ability, control time)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, state, found)\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   (Alice, FINDS, Magical Amulet)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, LOCATED_IN, Forbidden Forest)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, GRANTS_ABILITY, Alice) # Or (Alice, CONTROLS, Time)\n    *   (Alice, USES, Magical Amulet)\n    *   (Alice, PREVENTS, Dragon Attack) # Or (Alice, PREVENTS_ATTACK_BY(Dragon, Village))\n    *   (Dragon, ATTACKS, Village)\n\nBegin graph construction for the provided text.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Even so his robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed body. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the slightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon. The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple, and the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch so well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his mouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful whether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the main temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his enemy. Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the sword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork leaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a moment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets. Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms. Hurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and slipped it around her slim shivering shoulders. \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely. \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know that this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile crossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest. This amulet allowed her to control time, which she used to prevent the dragon from attacking the village.\"\n\n*   **Entities:** Alice (Character), Magical Amulet (Object), Forbidden Forest (Location), Time (Concept), Dragon (Character), Village (Location).\n*   **Properties:**\n    *   (Alice, motivation, prevent dragon attack)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, ability, control time)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, state, found)\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   (Alice, FINDS, Magical Amulet)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, LOCATED_IN, Forbidden Forest)\n    *   (Magical Amulet, GRANTS_ABILITY, Alice) # Or (Alice, CONTROLS, Time)\n    *   (Alice, USES, Magical Amulet)\n    *   (Alice, PREVENTS, Dragon Attack) # Or (Alice, PREVENTS_ATTACK_BY(Dragon, Village))\n    *   (Dragon, ATTACKS, Village)\n\nBegin graph construction for the provided text.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that had dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to battle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm. He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two warriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous gurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes. Noork grinned. From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not snore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed to a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would not give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the room. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged into the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer here in the artificial light of the flickering torch. Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the others. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two others, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering. The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies from the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the chamber of the sleeping guards.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

summary. \\n\\n**New Entities Identified:**\\n- Locations: 'Sekk' (with properties like gravity and fertility), 'twilight shore', 'central island', 'clump of drooping trees'.\\n- Objects: 'Dietrich's spacer' (with status 'crashed'), 'New York' (as a location tied to Noork's past), 'battered wrist watch' (with its condition and origin), 'long flat dugout' (noting its handling), 'mud' (with its yielding property), 'unseen wall', 'horizontal branch', 'braided leather'.\\n- People: 'Noork' (with his past association, remaining possession, and skill in paddling).\\n- Groups: 'Vasads' (identified by their action).\\n- Concepts/Events: None explicitly new and significant enough to warrant separate entities beyond what's captured in relationships.\\n\\n**New Relationships Identified:**\\n- **Doctor's actions and location:** 'LANDED_ON(Doctor, Sekk)', 'PREFERS_GRAVITY_OF(Doctor, Sekk)', 'POSSIBLE_RETURN_DESTINATION(Doctor, Earth)'.\\n- **Dietrich's spacer status:** 'CRASHED_ON(Dietrich's spacer, Sekk)'.\\n- **Noork's past and possessions:** 'ASSOCIATED_WITH_PAST(Noork, New York)', 'REMAINS_OF(Noork, battered wrist watch)'.\\n- **Noork's actions with the dugout:** 'PADDLES(Noork, long flat dugout)', 'MOVES_AWAY_FROM(Noork, twilight shore)', 'HANDLES_WELL(Noork, long flat dugout)', 'PULLS_OUT_OF_WATER(Noork, long flat dugout)'.\\n- **Dugout's journey and interactions:** 'HEADED_TOWARDS(long flat dugout, central island)', 'RAMMED_INTO(long flat dugout, mud)', 'MOVED_INTO_SHELTER_OF(long flat dugout, clump of drooping trees)'.\\n- **Obstacles and navigation:** 'COLLIDES_WITH(Noork, unseen wall)', 'CLIMBS_OVER_USING(Noork, horizontal branch)', 'EXTENDS_BEYOND(horizontal branch, unseen wall)', 'USES_FOR_LOWERING(Noork, braided leather)'.\\n- **Shared predicament:** 'TRAPPED_ON(Doctor, Cosmic matter)', 'TRAPPED_ON(young American pilot, Cosmic matter)'.\\n- **Cosmic matter's location:** 'LOCATED_BEYOND(Cosmic matter, Moon)'.\\n\\n**Entity Property Updates:**\\nNo existing entity properties were directly updated as the new information pertained to entities not previously detailed or established new connections. For instance, 'Noork' gained properties like 'past association' and 'remaining possession'. 'Sekk' gained properties describing its environment.\\n\\n**Reasoning for additions:**\\nThe text provides specific details about the characters' current situation (trapped on cosmic matter), their immediate actions (Noork paddling, colliding with a wall), the nature of their environment (Sekk, the dugout, the wall, the trees), and fragments of their past (Noork's connection to New York, his watch). These details were crucial for building a more complete narrative picture and were therefore extracted. The existing graph summary indicated a relatively sparse connection density, suggesting that many such details would be new additions. The 'Doctor' entity was likely already present, but its interaction with 'Sekk' and the 'Cosmic matter' was new information. The 'young American pilot' is likely also an existing entity, but their shared predicament of being 'TRAPPED_ON' the 'Cosmic matter' is a new relationship.\\n\\nNo direct updates were made to existing entity properties because the identified new information primarily constituted new entities and relationships, or properties of newly introduced entities. The prompt requested focus on new information not already captured. If, for example, 'Doctor' was an existing entity with a 'role' property, and the text described him as a 'wily scientist', then an `entity_property_updates` entry would have been generated for that specific update.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony structure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his hands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning gurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon it, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back. The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the shadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully. For a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction of the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then they jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to blood-slippery step. The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man with a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more. He sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a half-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps. In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging out, swords in hand.

guard', 'guard's throat'), the guards themselves in their various states ('startled guard', 'decapitated Misty One', 'guardian Misty One'), the 'unseen man', a 'shortened sword', the environment ('shadowy stair', 'blood-slippery step', 'torch-lighted doorway', 'descending shaft of steps'), a group ('fellows of this guard'), and an event ('struggle on the stair'). Properties were added to distinguish these entities (e.g., 'razor sharpness', 'decapitated', 'unseen', 'torch-lighted').\\n\\nNew relationships were established to detail the combat sequence described in the text. This includes 'ATTACKS' relationships between Noork and various guards, 'USES' relationship for Noork and his sword, and direct action relationships like 'BIT_THROUGH', 'SMASHES_BODY_OF', 'WRENCHED_FROM_HAND_JAMMED_INTO', 'CLAMPS_FINGERS_SHUT_ON_THROAT_OF', 'STABBED_AT_BACK_OF', 'STRUGGLES_WITH', 'ROLL_DOWN', 'SMASHES_AT', 'ARRESTS_DOWNWARD_COURSE_OF', 'JAR_ONWARD_FROM', 'CLUTCH', and 'SNAPS_NECK_OF'. Additionally, relationships describing Noork's awareness and the potential actions of other characters were created ('BECOMES_AWARE_OF', 'LOCATED_FURTHER_DOWN_ALONG', 'WOULD_COME_CHARGING_OUT_AT', 'WOULD_HAVE_HEARD').\\n\\nExisting entities were updated with new properties. For instance, the 'guard' entity was updated to reflect its state of being 'decapitated' and 'killed'. The 'sword' entity now includes its state of being 'wrenched from hand' and 'jammed into shoulder'. The 'man' entity (assumed to be the unseen man) was updated with 'unseen' state and its species as 'Misty One'. The 'Misty One' entity was specified as 'decapitated' and 'guardian'.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable graph that reveals the plot, character arcs, and causal relationships within a story.\n\n**Core Task:** Analyze the provided text to identify key narrative components and represent them as a knowledge graph.\n\n**Entity Extraction:**\nIdentify and extract all significant entities. Entities can be:\n*   **Characters:** Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters.\n*   **Locations:** Places where events occur.\n*   **Objects:** Important items or artifacts.\n*   **Concepts/Events:** Abstract ideas, significant plot points, or recurring themes.\n\nFor each entity, extract relevant **properties** that are narratively significant. These properties should describe:\n*   **Character attributes:** Personality traits, motivations, goals, relationships.\n*   **State changes:** How an entity's condition or status evolves (e.g., \"injured,\" \"memory erased,\" \"empowered\").\n*   **Temporal information:** When an entity or its state is relevant.\n*   **Descriptive details:** Key characteristics of objects or locations.\n\n**Relationship Extraction:**\nExtract **directed relationships** between entities. Prioritize relationships that convey:\n1.  **Actions and Events:** Who performed an action, what was the action, and on whom or what was it performed? Use verbs to describe actions. Examples: `HELPS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `ATTACKS(Antagonist, Protagonist)`, `TRAVELS_TO(Character, Location)`, `USES(Character, Object)`.\n2.  **Cause and Effect:** Explicitly identify causal links between events or actions. Examples: `CAUSES(EventX, EventY)`, `LEADS_TO(ActionA, OutcomeB)`.\n3.  **Character Interactions & Dynamics:** Describe the nature of relationships beyond simple association. Examples: `FRIENDS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `RIVALS_WITH(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `FEARS(CharacterA, CharacterB)`, `LOVES(CharacterA, CharacterB)`.\n4.  **Possession & Association:** Indicate ownership, belonging, or strong ties. Examples: `POSSESSES(Character, Object)`, `BELONGS_TO(Object, Character)`.\n5.  **Location and Containment:** Specify where entities are situated or contained. Examples: `LOCATED_IN(Entity, Location)`, `LIVES_IN(Character, Location)`.\n6.  **Temporal Sequencing:** Indicate the order of events. Use relationships like `PRECEDES(EventA, EventB)` or indicate temporal context within event properties.\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n*   Use **uppercase, descriptive, and specific verbs or verb phrases** for relationship types (e.g., `ACCUSES`, `DISCOVERS`, `TRANSFORMS`, `PRODUCES`).\n*   Avoid overly generic terms like \"related_to,\" \"associated_with,\" or \"has.\" If a generic relationship is necessary, ensure it's clearly defined by context or properties.\n*   Relationships are directed (Source Entity -> Relationship Type -> Target Entity).\n\n**Output Format:**\nRepresent the extracted information as a list of triplets: `(Source Entity, Relationship Type, Target Entity)` and a list of entity properties: `(Entity, Property Name, Property Value)`.\n\n**Prioritization:**\nFocus on entities and relationships that are crucial for understanding the main plot, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions. Capture the narrative arc and the causal chain of events.\n\n**Example (for clarity, not to be included in output):**\nText: \"Alice found the magical amulet in the forbidden forest.

And on the same dais there loomed two beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the wolf-headed shape a female. These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura worshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu! Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two upper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty Ones climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to the slaves and common citizens of the island. As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two short swords rose to bar his way. \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere gruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the most beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the sacrifice is chosen.\" Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.

crucial to the narrative unfolding in the text. Noork, a central character in this passage, is now explicitly defined as a 'slave' with detailed actions and motivations like searching for the 'lower pits', circling the 'inner wall', and his confrontation with the 'temple guards'. New locations like 'lower pits' and 'upper levels' are introduced, along with their access restrictions, highlighting the social hierarchy. The 'temple guards' are identified as a group with specific motivations (coveting slave women) and a duty to guard. The 'Misty Ones' are also introduced as a distinct group with access to restricted areas. Key objects and concepts like 'foul dank odor', 'stone steps', and 'clammy stone steps' are added to detail the environment and sensory experience. New relationships establish Noork's movement and actions (e.g., 'WALKS_DOWN', 'DETECTS', 'DARTED_TOWARD'), his restrictions ('CANNOT_ACCESS'), and his conflict ('ATTACKED'). The worship practices of the 'men of Zura' towards 'Uzdon' and 'Lornu' are detailed, and their representations ('lion-headed god', 'wolf-headed shape') are linked. Properties like gender have been added to Uzdon and Lornu, and their relationship as mates is established. The text also provides specific details about the environment, such as metal contrasting with draperies and the placement of images on a dais, leading to new relationships and properties. The 'High Priest' is identified, and his knowledge and the concept of a 'sacrifice' are established in relation to the temple guards' actions. Finally, a voice is attributed to the temple guards, revealing their gruff nature and warnings.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 4275, "user_prompt_length": 8668, "response_length": 17415, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 1417, "existing_graph_summary_length": 5954, "mode": "refinement"}}

Your goal is to construct a retrieval plan that effectively explores a knowledge graph to answer user queries. You must go beyond superficial entity extraction and focus on understanding the relational structure of the graph to construct a coherent answer.\n\n**Core Principles for Retrieval Planning:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relational Exploration:** When you identify key entities (nodes), your primary next step should be to explore their *relationships* (edges) using `get_neighbors(node_id, relationship_types=None)`. Do not simply extract more entities without understanding their connections.\n\n2.  **Infer Concepts from Relationships:** Abstract concepts like \"plot,\" \"conflict,\" \"motivation,\" or \"journey\" are not typically found as direct node labels. You must infer these by analyzing the *types* of relationships between entities. For example:\n    *   `travels to` relationships can indicate a journey.\n    *   `attacked`, `killed`, `betrayed` relationships signal conflict and turning points.\n    *   `interacts with`, `helps`, `hinders` relationships reveal character dynamics and plot progression.\n    *   If motivation is present, look for relationships like `desires`, `aims to achieve`, `wants to save`.\n\n3.  **Strategic Graph Traversal:** Plan your exploration sequentially.

Your goal is to construct a retrieval plan that effectively explores a knowledge graph to answer user queries. You must go beyond superficial entity extraction and focus on understanding the relational structure of the graph to construct a coherent answer.\n\n**Core Principles for Retrieval Planning:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relational Exploration:** When you identify key entities (nodes), your primary next step should be to explore their *relationships* (edges) using `get_neighbors(node_id, relationship_types=None)`. Do not simply extract more entities without understanding their connections.\n\n2.  **Infer Concepts from Relationships:** Abstract concepts like \"plot,\" \"conflict,\" \"motivation,\" or \"journey\" are not typically found as direct node labels. You must infer these by analyzing the *types* of relationships between entities. For example:\n    *   `travels to` relationships can indicate a journey.\n    *   `attacked`, `killed`, `betrayed` relationships signal conflict and turning points.\n    *   `interacts with`, `helps`, `hinders` relationships reveal character dynamics and plot progression.\n    *   If motivation is present, look for relationships like `desires`, `aims to achieve`, `wants to save`.\n\n3.  **Strategic Graph Traversal:** Plan your exploration sequentially. After identifying initial entities, trace their connections to understand their roles and actions within the narrative or topic. Use the information gathered at each step to inform the next.\n\n4.  **Avoid Literal Keyword Searches for Abstract Concepts:** Do not use `search_nodes_by_keyword('plot')` or similar broad, literal searches for abstract narrative elements.

Your goal is to construct a retrieval plan that effectively explores a knowledge graph to answer user queries. You must go beyond superficial entity extraction and focus on understanding the relational structure of the graph to construct a coherent answer.\n\n**Core Principles for Retrieval Planning:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relational Exploration:** When you identify key entities (nodes), your primary next step should be to explore their *relationships* (edges) using `get_neighbors(node_id, relationship_types=None)`. Do not simply extract more entities without understanding their connections.\n\n2.  **Infer Concepts from Relationships:** Abstract concepts like \"plot,\" \"conflict,\" \"motivation,\" or \"journey\" are not typically found as direct node labels. You must infer these by analyzing the *types* of relationships between entities. For example:\n    *   `travels to` relationships can indicate a journey.\n    *   `attacked`, `killed`, `betrayed` relationships signal conflict and turning points.\n    *   `interacts with`, `helps`, `hinders` relationships reveal character dynamics and plot progression.\n    *   If motivation is present, look for relationships like `desires`, `aims to achieve`, `wants to save`.\n\n3.  **Strategic Graph Traversal:** Plan your exploration sequentially. After identifying initial entities, trace their connections to understand their roles and actions within the narrative or topic. Use the information gathered at each step to inform the next.\n\n4.  **Avoid Literal Keyword Searches for Abstract Concepts:** Do not use `search_nodes_by_keyword('plot')` or similar broad, literal searches for abstract narrative elements. Instead, *construct* an understanding of the plot by piecing together events, character actions, and their causal or sequential relationships.\n\n5.  **Leverage Specific Node and Relationship Types:** Pay close attention to the `node_types` and `relationship_types` available in the graph schema. Use these specific labels to guide your search and exploration for relevant information that directly contributes to answering the query.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nGiven a user query, generate a sequence of retrieval actions. Each action should be a call to one of the following functions:\n*   `search_nodes_by_keyword(keyword: str, limit: int = 10)`: Use this for specific, concrete entities or well-defined concepts that are likely to be node labels or properties.\n*   `get_neighbors(node_id: str, relationship_types: Optional[List[str]] = None, limit: int = 10)`: **This is your primary tool for understanding relationships and plot.** Use this after identifying relevant nodes.\n*   `get_node_details(node_id: str)`: Use this to retrieve properties of a specific node when its ID is known.\n\nYour plan should be a Python list of function calls, ensuring that each step logically builds upon the previous one to gather information necessary to answer the query by understanding the graph's relational structure.

Therefore, I cannot provide a plot summary for any story,\" indicates a fundamental misunderstanding or a lack of relevant information.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why the response is problematic and how it can be improved:\n\n**Problems with the Current Response:**\n\n1.  **Misinterpretation of \"The Story\":** The system assumes \"the story\" refers to a story *within* its knowledge graph or retrieved documents. When it finds no such story data, it concludes there's nothing to summarize. It doesn't consider that the user might be referring to a story *outside* of the RAG system's immediate context, or that the system itself might be the \"story\" in a metaphorical sense (e.g., the story of how the system operates).\n2.  **Over-reliance on a Specific Data Structure (\"Graph\"):** The mention of an \"empty graph\" suggests the system's retrieval mechanism or internal representation is heavily tied to graph data. If the user's query isn't directly mappable to this structure, the system fails completely. This isn't user-friendly.\n3.  **Lack of Clarification or Guidance:** Instead of just stating it can't help, the response could guide the user on how to get help. The suggestion \"If you have information about a specific story or a knowledge graph that contains details about plots, please provide it\" is a good start, but it's still very technical (\"knowledge graph\").\n4.  **Abrupt and Unhelpful:** While polite, the response doesn't try to bridge the gap or offer alternative interpretations.\n\n**How to Improve the Response:**\n\nThe core issue is the system's inability to understand the user's intent when its direct data source is empty. The improvement should focus on:\n*   **Clarifying the ambiguity:** Ask the user for more context.\n*   **Acknowledging limitations gracefully:** Explain *why* it can't answer, but do so in simpler terms.\n*   **Providing actionable next steps:** Guide the user on how to rephrase their query or provide the necessary information.\n\nHere are several improved response options, ranging from simple to more sophisticated:\n\n**Improvement Option 1 (More Direct Clarification):**\n\n> \"I can't seem to find any information about a specific story in my current data. Could you please tell me which story you're interested in? If you can provide the title or a brief description, I'll try my best to find its plot for you.\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** Directly asks for clarification about *which* story. Avoids technical jargon like \"graph.\"\n\n**Improvement Option 2 (Acknowledging Potential Lack of Data and Guiding):**\n\n> \"I'm sorry, but I don't have any specific story details or plot information available right now. To help me understand what you're looking for, could you please:\n>\n> 1.  **Specify the story:** What is the title of the story you're interested in?\n> 2.  **Provide context:** Are you referring to a story discussed earlier, or a specific book, movie, or event?\n>\n> Once I have more information, I'll do my best to find the plot summary for you.\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** More structured, offers clear options for the user, and explains *why* it needs more info.\n\n**Improvement Option 3 (Slightly More Empathetic and Flexible):**\n\n> \"It seems I'm missing the information needed to tell you the plot of 'the story.' My current knowledge doesn't contain details about any particular narrative.\n>\n> To help me assist you, could you please provide more context? For example:\n>\n> *   What is the name of the story?\n> *   Where might I find information about it (e.g., a book title, a movie, a previous conversation topic)?\n>\n> I'm ready to help if you can give me a bit more to go on!\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** Uses softer language (\"missing the information,\" \"narrative\"). Offers flexible examples of what \"context\" could mean.\n\n**Improvement Option 4 (If the RAG system *can* process external text):**\n\n> \"I don't have a specific story pre-loaded or indexed that I can summarize. However, if you can provide me with the text of the story, or tell me its title and where it comes from (like a book, movie, or website), I can try to process that information and tell you the plot.\"\n\n*   **Why it's better:** Clearly states its limitations but also offers a path forward if the user can supply the data directly.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Improvement:**\n\n*   **User-Centric Language:** Avoid internal technical terms like \"graph,\" \"nodes,\" or \"connections\" unless absolutely necessary and explained.\n*   **Clarification is Key:** When ambiguity exists (like \"the story\"), ask clarifying questions.\n*   **Actionable Suggestions:** Guide the user on *how* they can get the answer they need.\n*   **Flexibility:** The system should be able to handle queries that don't perfectly map to its internal structure. It should try to infer user intent or ask for more data.\n\nThe original response failed because it treated the query as a direct data lookup and, upon finding no data, gave up.

The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man with a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more. He sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a half-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps. In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging out, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle on the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion of the upper temple was muted to a murmur. So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that had dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to battle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm. He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes.

Noork knew that now the two guards would not give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the room. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged into the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer here in the artificial light of the flickering torch.

For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of the cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour the great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death of the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the words that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated them aloud. \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\" The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going back to the bow slung across her shoulder.

One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened.

The relationship types were chosen to best represent the interaction or connection described. Finally, these relationships were distilled into subject-predicate-object triplets for a structured representation of the information. For instance, 'Misty Ones' and 'mainland' are linked by 'lives_in' because the text states they dwell there. 'Noork' and 'priest of the Skull' are linked by 'confronts' due to Noork drawing his sword to face him. The reasoning for identifying 'Uzdon' as an organization is its association with 'priests'.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 0, "user_prompt_length": 2208, "response_length": 6931, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 1360, "mode": "creation"}}
