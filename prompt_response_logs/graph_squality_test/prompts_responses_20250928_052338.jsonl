It correctly identifies that it cannot fulfill the user's request based on the provided context, but it fails to offer any guidance or alternative solutions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the evaluation and improvement suggestions:\n\n## Evaluation of the Response:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Honesty and Accuracy:** The response is truthful about its limitations. It doesn't hallucinate or invent information.\n*   **Clear Explanation of Limitation:** It clearly states *why* it cannot provide a plot summary â€“ the retrieved data only contains character information and a statement about unexplored connections, lacking narrative details.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Helpfulness:** While accurate, the response is a dead end for the user. It simply says \"I can't do it\" without offering any way forward.\n*   **Missed Opportunity for Guidance:** The system could have provided more constructive feedback to help the user refine their query or understand what kind of information is needed.\n*   **No Alternative Actions:** It doesn't suggest what the user *could* do next.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to transform the response from a \"cannot do\" to a more helpful \"here's what I can do, or what you need to do.\"\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, ranging from simple to more advanced:\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 1: Provide More Context and Suggest Next Steps\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I am sorry, but I cannot provide a plot summary with the current information. The documents I have access to only list characters and mention that their connections haven't been explored, which doesn't contain any narrative details like plot points, events, or story progression.\n>\n> To help me provide a plot summary, could you please provide more information? For example, you could share:\n>\n> *   A description of the story's events.\n> *   A synopsis of the narrative.\n> *   Details about the main conflicts and resolutions.\n> *   Information about the story's beginning, middle, and end.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Reinforces the \"Why\":** It reiterates *why* the plot cannot be summarized, making the limitation clearer.\n*   **Actionable Guidance:** It directly tells the user what kind of information is needed, empowering them to provide better input.\n*   **Specific Examples:** Giving concrete examples of what constitutes \"narrative details\" helps the user understand the system's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 2: Offer Available Information and Suggest Synthesis\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I can't provide a full plot summary with the current information. The retrieved data mainly consists of a list of characters and a note stating that their connections have not yet been explored. This means I don't have details about the story's events, conflicts, or resolution.\n>\n> However, I *can* tell you about the characters mentioned if you'd like. Or, if you have additional details about the story's plot, please provide them, and I'll do my best to summarize it for you.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Highlights Available Data:** It acknowledges what *is* present in the context, even if it's not what the user asked for. This shows the system is processing the information.\n*   **Offers Alternative Actions:** It provides a specific alternative (listing characters) that it *can* do, making the interaction more productive.\n*   **Open-ended Invitation:** It keeps the door open for the user to provide the missing information.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 3: Proactive Information Seeking (if applicable)\n\nThis strategy assumes the RAG system has the ability to search for additional relevant documents or information if the initial retrieval is insufficient.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I'm unable to generate a plot summary based on the initial information retrieved, which only lists characters and notes unexplored connections. This data lacks narrative details essential for a plot summary.\n>\n> Would you like me to try searching for additional documents that might contain plot information for this story? Alternatively, if you have any plot details you can share, I can use those to create a summary.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Offers System-Initiated Action:** This is the most proactive. It suggests the RAG system can *try* to find the missing information, which is a significant value-add.\n*   **Presents Options Clearly:** It still gives the user the choice to either let the system search or provide the information themselves.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Strategy 4: More Empathetic and Explanatory Tone\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"I understand you're looking for a plot summary, but unfortunately, the information I've retrieved doesn't contain the necessary narrative details.

If you could provide any of those details, I'd be happy to assist!\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvement:**\n\n*   **Empathy:** Starts with acknowledging the user's request and intent (\"I understand you're looking for...\").\n*   **Clearer Explanation of \"Narrative Details\":** Breaks down what \"narrative details\" actually means in the context of a plot.\n\n---\n\n## General Principles for Improvement:\n\n1.  **Be More Than Just a \"No\":** Don't just state limitations; provide solutions or guidance.\n2.  **Explain *Why*:** Clearly articulate the reason for the inability to fulfill the request.\n3.  **Suggest Alternatives:** Offer what *can* be done with the available information.\n4.  **Guide the User:** Tell the user what information they need to provide for a successful outcome.\n5.  **Manage Expectations:** Be clear about what the system can and cannot do.\n6.  **Be Action-Oriented:** Frame the response around what actions can be taken, either by the system or the user.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can transform a disappointing \"I can't\" into a helpful and engaging interaction.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the retrieved content can be improved.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

Here's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n**Critique of Retrieved Context:**\n\n1.  **Redundant and Inconsistent Information:**\n    *   Iteration 1 and Iteration 3 results are virtually identical, both listing a large number of characters and stating that their connections \"have not been explored yet.\" This indicates a potential issue with the graph generation or exploration process. The system is repeatedly identifying entities but failing to extract or explore any relationships between them.\n    *   Iteration 2 explicitly states an \"empty graph,\" which directly contradicts Iterations 1 and 3. This inconsistency suggests a fundamental failure in graph construction or retrieval across different stages.\n\n2.  **Lack of Narrative Information:**\n    *   The primary flaw is the complete absence of any actual plot elements. The context *only* provides character names and a status update on their connections.\n    *   Phrases like \"The connections of Node [Character Name] have not been explored yet\" are metadata about the graph's state, not content from the original story. This is precisely why the LLM correctly stated it cannot provide a plot summary.\n\n3.  **Ineffective Graph Exploration:**\n    *   The core issue seems to be that the graph exploration agent is either not being invoked effectively or is not programmed to extract narrative information. The agent's function seems limited to identifying nodes and stating their connections are unexplored, which is not useful for plot summarization.\n    *   There's no indication that the agent is performing any meaningful analysis, such as identifying central characters, detecting communities of characters, or querying relationships *from* the identified entities.\n\n**How to Improve Retrieved Content:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Relationship Extraction and Narrative Events:**\n    *   The graph generation LLM (for each chunk) and the graph exploration agent need to be tasked with extracting *relationships* that imply actions, events, or interactions. Instead of just listing \"Captain Dietrich\" and \"Doctor,\" the system should aim to identify and represent connections like \"Captain Dietrich *talked to* Doctor,\" \"Doctor *treated* the prisoner,\" or \"Greg Weeks *flew with* the young American pilot.\"\n    *   The graph should represent narrative arcs, not just character lists.\n\n2.  **Enhance Graph Exploration Agent Capabilities:**\n    *   The agent needs functions that can traverse the graph to identify sequences of events or causal links between characters. For example, it should be able to find paths between characters, identify who is acting upon whom, and what the outcomes are.\n    *   The agent should actively query for relationships that describe plot points (e.g., \"What happened to the prisoners?\", \"Who is fighting whom?\").\n\n3.  **Ensure Consistent Graph Generation:**\n    *   The inconsistency between Iteration 1/3 (list of unexplored nodes) and Iteration 2 (empty graph) must be resolved. The system needs to reliably produce a graph that reflects the content of the input text. This might involve refining the chunking strategy or the LLM prompts used for graph extraction.\n\n4.  **Incorporate Entity Linking and Coreference Resolution:**\n    *   The current context lists many similar entities (e.g., \"Doctor,\" \"Doctor Karl Von Mark,\" \"Doctor Von Mark,\" \"Von Mark\"). The system should consolidate these into a single, canonical entity to avoid fragmentation and ensure all information related to a character is linked. Similarly, resolving pronouns and different mentions of the same character is crucial.\n\nIn essence, the current retrieved content is just a very poorly organized character list, failing entirely to capture the story's plot, which is the user's explicit goal.

An LLM selects the hyperparameters (chunk size). The input text (where the information is located) is split into chunks based on the chosen chunk size. For each chunk, an LLM is used to extract a graph. The graphs are then merged. An LLM agent has access to a set of functions to explore the graph (the set is fixed and includes queries on entities and relations based on type or name, access to neighbors, community detection, and identification of central nodes). The context obtained from the exploration is then passed to an LLM together with the query. The LLM generates an answer.\n\nHere are some examples of retrieval plans, with the retrieved contents:\nRetrieval Plan: Move 1: The query asks about the plot of the story. The plot is typically driven by the actions and interactions of characters. Therefore, the first step is to identify all the 'Person' nodes in the graph to understand who the key players are.\nMove 2: The user is asking about the plot of the story. I should search for nodes that are related to the concept of 'plot'.\nMove 3: The query asks about the plot of a story, which is likely to involve characters and their interactions. Since the previous steps have not yielded useful information, I will start by searching for all nodes of type 'Person' to get a comprehensive list of characters that might be central to the plot.\nMove 4: The user wants to know the plot of the story. To understand the plot, it is essential to know the characters involved. Therefore, I will search for all nodes of type 'Person'.\nMove 5: The user is asking for the plot of the story. To understand the plot, I need to identify the main characters involved. Since 'Person' is a common node type and is relevant to understanding the plot, I will search for all nodes of type 'Person'.\nMove 6: The user is asking for the plot of the story. To understand the plot, it's crucial to identify the main characters involved. Since 'Person' is a common node type and is likely to contain key characters that drive the narrative, searching for nodes of type 'Person' is a good first step to gather information about the story's protagonists and antagonists.\nRetrieved Context: \n\nIteration 1 results:\nG describes a graph among nodes Captain Dietrich, Doctor, Doctor Karl Von Mark, Doctor Von Mark, Greg Weeks, Gurn, High Priest, Lornu, Mary Meehan, Noork, Rold, Sarna, Stephen Dietrich, The Misty One, Tholon Dist, Tholon Sarna, Two warriors, Ud, Von Mark, common citizens, girl, golden skinned girl, guard on his left, guard on his right hand, guards, men from Wari, men of Zura, priests, prisoners, red-haired young American flier, slave, slave women, temple guards, the dead man, the fatter of the two men, the girl, the golden-skinned girl, the guard, the slave, young American pilot.

The system identifies characters (nodes) but does not extract the relationships (edges) that constitute the plot. The goal of understanding the \"plot\" necessitates understanding character interactions, conflicts, and resolutions, none of which are represented in the retrieved context.\n\n2.  **Inconsistent Graph Generation:** The system oscillates between producing a graph with many nodes but no connections (Iterations 1, 3, 4, 6) and an empty graph (Iterations 2, 5). This inconsistency suggests a deep problem with the initial graph construction or merging phases, making any subsequent exploration futile.\n\n3.  **Ineffective Exploration Strategy:** The agent's actions (implied by the results) are not geared towards plot understanding. Simply listing nodes and their unexplored connections does not serve the query. The agent needs to actively query for relationships, sequences of events, or character interactions.\n\n4.  **Lack of Entity Resolution:** The presence of multiple variations for the same character (e.g., \"Doctor,\" \"Doctor Karl Von Mark,\" \"Doctor Von Mark,\" \"Von Mark\") suggests a lack of coreference resolution. This fragmented representation hinders the ability to consolidate information about a single entity.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Edge/Relationship Extraction:** The LLM prompts for graph generation from text chunks must be explicitly designed to extract *relationships* between entities, not just the entities themselves. This includes actions, dialogue attributions, causes and effects, and conflicts.\n2.  **Develop Targeted Exploration Queries:** The agent's exploration steps should be guided by the query for \"plot.\" Instead of generic \"explore connections,\" it should attempt to find paths between key characters, identify central actions, or query for specific event types.\n3.  **Ensure Graph Coherence:** The system must consistently produce a graph that reflects the input text. This might involve refining the chunking strategy, improving the graph merging algorithm, or better error handling in the graph generation LLMs.\n4.  **Implement Entity Consolidation:** Incorporate entity linking and coreference resolution mechanisms early in the process to ensure that all information related to a single character is associated with a unified node.\n\nIn summary, the current plan and its execution demonstrate a systemic failure to capture narrative elements.

The most common entity type is \"Location\" with 45 instances. The most frequent relationship type is \"attacked\" with 7 occurrences.\nRetrieval Plan: The user is asking for the plot of the story. To understand the plot, it's crucial to identify the main characters involved. Since 'Person' is a common node type and is likely to contain key characters that drive the narrative, searching for nodes of type 'Person' is a good first step to gather information about the story's protagonists and antagonists.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nThe retrieval plan is **critically flawed** as it consistently fails to extract any meaningful information related to the plot. The core issue is the system's inability to move beyond identifying entities and their status as \"unexplored.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the major problems and recommendations for improvement:\n\n**Critique of the Retrieval Plan and Execution:**\n\n1.  **Failure to Extract Relationships and Events:** The repeated output, \"The connections of Node [Character Name] have not been explored yet,\" indicates a fundamental failure in the graph extraction and exploration process. The system identifies characters (nodes) but does not extract the relationships (edges) that constitute the plot. The goal of understanding the \"plot\" necessitates understanding character interactions, conflicts, and resolutions, none of which are represented in the retrieved context.\n\n2.  **Inconsistent Graph Generation:** The system oscillates between producing a graph with many nodes but no connections (Iterations 1, 3, 4, 6) and an empty graph (Iterations 2, 5). This inconsistency suggests a deep problem with the initial graph construction or merging phases, making any subsequent exploration futile.\n\n3.  **Ineffective Exploration Strategy:** The agent's actions (implied by the results) are not geared towards plot understanding. Simply listing nodes and their unexplored connections does not serve the query. The agent needs to actively query for relationships, sequences of events, or character interactions.\n\n4.  **Lack of Entity Resolution:** The presence of multiple variations for the same character (e.g., \"Doctor,\" \"Doctor Karl Von Mark,\" \"Doctor Von Mark,\" \"Von Mark\") suggests a lack of coreference resolution. This fragmented representation hinders the ability to consolidate information about a single entity.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Edge/Relationship Extraction:** The LLM prompts for graph generation from text chunks must be explicitly designed to extract *relationships* between entities, not just the entities themselves. This includes actions, dialogue attributions, causes and effects, and conflicts.\n2.  **Develop Targeted Exploration Queries:** The agent's exploration steps should be guided by the query for \"plot.\" Instead of generic \"explore connections,\" it should attempt to find paths between key characters, identify central actions, or query for specific event types.\n3.  **Ensure Graph Coherence:** The system must consistently produce a graph that reflects the input text. This might involve refining the chunking strategy, improving the graph merging algorithm, or better error handling in the graph generation LLMs.\n4.  **Implement Entity Consolidation:** Incorporate entity linking and coreference resolution mechanisms early in the process to ensure that all information related to a single character is associated with a unified node.\n\nIn summary, the current plan and its execution demonstrate a systemic failure to capture narrative elements. The system identifies characters but fails to understand their roles or interactions, rendering it incapable of answering plot-related questions.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique that will be used to improve the retrieval planning prompt.  \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing. Focus on the most critical points and be concise.", "user_prompt": "Please provide your critique and feedback.", "llm_response": "## Critique of Retrieval Plans for \"What is the plot of the story?\"\n\nThe current retrieval plans are **fundamentally flawed** due to a consistent failure to extract any meaningful plot-related information. The core problem is the system's inability to move beyond identifying entities and their status as \"unexplored.\"\n\n**Major Issues:**\n\n1.  **Absence of Relationship/Event Extraction:** The repeated outcome of \"The connections of Node [Character Name] have not been explored yet\" clearly indicates that the graph generation and exploration phases are not capturing the narrative fabric of the story. The plot is defined by character interactions, conflicts, and causal links, none of which are being surfaced. The LLM's focus appears to be on entity identification rather than the relationships that form the plot.\n\n2.  **Ineffective Exploration Strategy:** The chosen retrieval actions (e.g., `search_nodes_by_types(\"Person\")`) are too generic. While identifying characters is a starting point, the plans do not incorporate steps to explore their *interactions*, *actions*, or *motivations*â€”elements crucial for understanding a plot. The agent needs to actively query for relationship types like \"attacked,\" \"collaborates with,\" \"betrays,\" etc., rather than passively waiting for exploration.\n\n3.  **Lack of Focus on Narrative Structure:** The query is about \"plot,\" which implies a sequence of events and their causal relationships. The current strategy does not leverage any functions that could help reconstruct this narrative, such as analyzing paths between key events or characters, or identifying pivotal actions.\n\n4.  **Inconsistent/Empty Graph Generation (Implied):** While not explicitly detailed in *every* prompt, the repeated \"connections not explored\" suggests that either the graphs are being generated without relationships or the exploration functions are not correctly retrieving them, leading to a barren graph structure. This inconsistency prevents any progress.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relationship and Event Extraction in Graph Generation:** The prompts for generating graphs from text chunks must explicitly instruct the LLM to extract *relationships* between entities, including actions, motivations, and events, not just the entities themselves.\n2.  **Develop Targeted Exploration Steps:** The retrieval plan should include steps to specifically search for relationship types relevant to plot development (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"converses with,\" \"agrees to help,\" \"antagonist\"). The agent needs to actively probe for these connections.\n3.  **Integrate Narrative Reconstruction Functions:** Consider utilizing functions that can help build a narrative. For example, once key characters or events are identified, using `analyze_path` between them could reveal plot progression.\n4.  **Refine Entity Understanding:** The system should aim to identify not just *who* is in the story but *what they do* and *how they relate to each other*.

The LLM's focus appears to be on entity identification rather than the relationships that form the plot.\n\n2.  **Ineffective Exploration Strategy:** The chosen retrieval actions (e.g., `search_nodes_by_types(\"Person\")`) are too generic. While identifying characters is a starting point, the plans do not incorporate steps to explore their *interactions*, *actions*, or *motivations*â€”elements crucial for understanding a plot. The agent needs to actively query for relationship types like \"attacked,\" \"collaborates with,\" \"betrays,\" etc., rather than passively waiting for exploration.\n\n3.  **Lack of Focus on Narrative Structure:** The query is about \"plot,\" which implies a sequence of events and their causal relationships. The current strategy does not leverage any functions that could help reconstruct this narrative, such as analyzing paths between key events or characters, or identifying pivotal actions.\n\n4.  **Inconsistent/Empty Graph Generation (Implied):** While not explicitly detailed in *every* prompt, the repeated \"connections not explored\" suggests that either the graphs are being generated without relationships or the exploration functions are not correctly retrieving them, leading to a barren graph structure. This inconsistency prevents any progress.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relationship and Event Extraction in Graph Generation:** The prompts for generating graphs from text chunks must explicitly instruct the LLM to extract *relationships* between entities, including actions, motivations, and events, not just the entities themselves.\n2.  **Develop Targeted Exploration Steps:** The retrieval plan should include steps to specifically search for relationship types relevant to plot development (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"converses with,\" \"agrees to help,\" \"antagonist\"). The agent needs to actively probe for these connections.\n3.  **Integrate Narrative Reconstruction Functions:** Consider utilizing functions that can help build a narrative. For example, once key characters or events are identified, using `analyze_path` between them could reveal plot progression.\n4.  **Refine Entity Understanding:** The system should aim to identify not just *who* is in the story but *what they do* and *how they relate to each other*. This requires focusing on the semantic meaning of relationships.\n\nBased on this critique, generate a new system prompt that will be used to instruct the LLM how to better plan graph retrieval strategies. The system prompt should incorporate the feedback to improve retrieval strategy, function selection, and information gathering.\n\nProvide only the optimized system prompt without additional commentary.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your response to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

Your goal is to construct a sequence of tool calls that effectively extracts information from a knowledge graph to answer user queries.\n\nWhen planning retrieval steps, prioritize understanding the **narrative and causal relationships** within the data, especially when the query relates to plot, events, or character interactions. Avoid plans that solely focus on identifying entities without exploring their connections.\n\n**Core Principles for Planning:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Relationships and Events:** The plot of a story is defined by how entities interact, their actions, motivations, and the causal links between events. Your retrieval plans must actively seek to uncover these connections. When exploring nodes, prioritize functions that retrieve *relationships* or *connected nodes based on specific relationship types*.\n2.  **Targeted Information Gathering:** Do not rely on generic searches. If a query is about a character's role in the plot, plan steps to find:\n    *   What actions they took (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"performed_action\")`).\n    *   Who they interacted with and how (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"collaborates_with\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"opposes\")`).\n    *   The consequences of their actions or events (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"caused_by\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"led_to\")`).\n3.  **Narrative Reconstruction:** For plot-related queries, consider how to piece together a sequence of events. Functions like `analyze_path` can be crucial for understanding the progression between key entities or events.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** If initial steps yield limited relevant information (e.g., nodes with no explored connections), refine your plan to probe deeper into specific relationship types or explore alternative paths.\n5.  **Function Selection:** Choose functions that directly address the query's intent.\n    *   Use `search_nodes_by_types` primarily for initial entity identification or when relationship information is sparse.\n    *   Prioritize `get_node_by_relationship` and `get_nodes_by_relationships` to explore connections.\n    *   Utilize `analyze_path` to understand narrative flow.\n\n**Example:** If the query is \"What is the plot of the story?\" and you've identified the main character \"Alice,\" do not just search for more \"Person\" nodes. Instead, plan to find:\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"performed_action\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"met\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"fought\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"involved_in\")`\n\nAlways consider the *meaning* of relationships in the context of the query.

The plot is typically driven by the actions and interactions of characters. Therefore, the first step is to identify all the 'Person' nodes in the graph to understand who the key players are.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nThe retrieval plan is **critically flawed** as it consistently fails to extract any meaningful information related to the plot. The core issue is the system's inability to move beyond identifying entities and their status as \"unexplored.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the major problems and recommendations for improvement:\n\n**Critique of the Retrieval Plan and Execution:**\n\n1.  **Failure to Extract Relationships and Events:** The repeated output, \"The connections of Node [Character Name] have not been explored yet,\" indicates a fundamental failure in the graph extraction and exploration process. The system identifies characters (nodes) but does not extract the relationships (edges) that constitute the plot. The goal of understanding the \"plot\" necessitates understanding character interactions, conflicts, and resolutions, none of which are represented in the retrieved context.\n\n2.  **Inconsistent Graph Generation:** The system oscillates between producing a graph with many nodes but no connections (Iterations 1, 3, 4, 6) and an empty graph (Iterations 2, 5). This inconsistency suggests a deep problem with the initial graph construction or merging phases, making any subsequent exploration futile.\n\n3.  **Ineffective Exploration Strategy:** The agent's actions (implied by the results) are not geared towards plot understanding. Simply listing nodes and their unexplored connections does not serve the query. The agent needs to actively query for relationships, sequences of events, or character interactions.\n\n4.  **Lack of Entity Resolution:** The presence of multiple variations for the same character (e.g., \"Doctor,\" \"Doctor Karl Von Mark,\" \"Doctor Von Mark,\" \"Von Mark\") suggests a lack of coreference resolution. This fragmented representation hinders the ability to consolidate information about a single entity.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Edge/Relationship Extraction:** The LLM prompts for graph generation from text chunks must be explicitly designed to extract *relationships* between entities, not just the entities themselves. This includes actions, dialogue attributions, causes and effects, and conflicts.\n2.  **Develop Targeted Exploration Queries:** The agent's exploration steps should be guided by the query for \"plot.\" Instead of generic \"explore connections,\" it should attempt to find paths between key characters, identify central actions, or query for specific event types.\n3.  **Ensure Graph Coherence:** The system must consistently produce a graph that reflects the input text. This might involve refining the chunking strategy, improving the graph merging algorithm, or better error handling in the graph generation LLMs.\n4.  **Implement Entity Consolidation:** Incorporate entity linking and coreference resolution mechanisms early in the process to ensure that all information related to a single character is associated with a unified node.\n\nIn summary, the current plan and its execution demonstrate a systemic failure to capture narrative elements. The system identifies characters but fails to understand their roles or interactions, rendering it incapable of answering plot-related questions.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the graph can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

While it captures many specific interactions (e.g., \"wields,\" \"located in\"), it misses crucial narrative connectors.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Introduce and prioritize relationship types that represent plot progression. Examples include:\n        *   `causes`, `leads to`, `results in` (for causal chains)\n        *   `conflict with`, `opposes`, `ally with` (for character dynamics and stakes)\n        *   `initiates event`, `participates in`, `resolves` (for action sequences)\n        *   `sequence of` (to explicitly order events)\n\n2.  **Weak Event Representation:** The graph contains an \"Event\" node type but lacks depth in how events are structured and connected. A plot is fundamentally a sequence of events, often with escalating stakes.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Enhance event representation. Consider:\n        *   Making \"Event\" a more central node type.\n        *   Creating relationships between events, e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`.\n        *   Attaching characters and locations directly to specific events they are involved in, rather than just general associations.\n\n3.  **Entity-Centric vs. Narrative-Centric Approach:** The graph is heavily entity-centric (listing many \"Person\" and \"Location\" nodes). While identifying entities is a prerequisite, the *connections* and *actions* between them are what form the plot. The current graph struggles to surface these narrative threads.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Shift focus during graph generation to explicitly extract narrative actions and their consequences. The LLM prompts for graph building should emphasize identifying verbs and their subjects/objects as plot-driving relationships.\n\n4.  **Limited Contextual Depth:** The sheer number of relationship types, many with only one or two instances, suggests a potential over-fragmentation of information. It's difficult to discern overarching themes or the main storyline from such a fragmented representation.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Prioritize higher-frequency, plot-relevant relationships during graph construction. Consider a hierarchical or thematic grouping of relationships if granularity is proving detrimental to narrative coherence.\n\nIn essence, the graph needs to evolve from a descriptive catalog of entities and their static links to a dynamic representation of narrative flow, causality, and character agency.

While it captures many specific interactions (e.g., \"wields,\" \"located in\"), it misses crucial narrative connectors.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Introduce and prioritize relationship types that represent plot progression. Examples include:\n        *   `causes`, `leads to`, `results in` (for causal chains)\n        *   `conflict with`, `opposes`, `ally with` (for character dynamics and stakes)\n        *   `initiates event`, `participates in`, `resolves` (for action sequences)\n        *   `sequence of` (to explicitly order events)\n\n2.  **Weak Event Representation:** The graph contains an \"Event\" node type but lacks depth in how events are structured and connected. A plot is fundamentally a sequence of events, often with escalating stakes.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Enhance event representation. Consider:\n        *   Making \"Event\" a more central node type.\n        *   Creating relationships between events, e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`.\n        *   Attaching characters and locations directly to specific events they are involved in, rather than just general associations.\n\n3.  **Entity-Centric vs. Narrative-Centric Approach:** The graph is heavily entity-centric (listing many \"Person\" and \"Location\" nodes). While identifying entities is a prerequisite, the *connections* and *actions* between them are what form the plot. The current graph struggles to surface these narrative threads.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Shift focus during graph generation to explicitly extract narrative actions and their consequences. The LLM prompts for graph building should emphasize identifying verbs and their subjects/objects as plot-driving relationships.\n\n4.  **Limited Contextual Depth:** The sheer number of relationship types, many with only one or two instances, suggests a potential over-fragmentation of information.

Avoid sizes that frequently split core plot points or decision-action-consequence sequences. A larger chunk size can better preserve the context needed for the LLM to identify and link these narrative threads.\n*   **Event Completeness:** Assess if a chunk size allows for the holistic representation of events. Can an event, its key participants, and its immediate outcomes be captured within a single chunk?\n*   **Contextual Depth vs. Dilution:** A larger chunk size generally increases contextual depth, promoting a more narrative-centric graph. However, excessively large chunks might dilute specific information or exceed LLM context window limitations. Strive for a balance that provides sufficient narrative context without losing granularity.\n*   **Bias Mitigation:** Aim to move away from an entity-centric bias towards a more narrative-centric graph by ensuring chunks are large enough to contain meaningful narrative progression, not just isolated entity descriptions.\n\n**Output Requirements:**\nProvide a reasoned recommendation for a chunk size (or a range) for the given document.

Your primary goal is to guide the selection of optimal chunk sizes for graph construction, focusing on enhancing narrative structure and causality.\n\n**Critique Summary:**\nThe current approach has shown issues where a chunk size of 150 tokens can lead to:\n1.  **Fragmented Causality:** Cause-and-effect relationships spanning chunk boundaries are missed.\n2.  **Incomplete Event Representation:** Events are split, losing their full scope and context.\n3.  **Entity-Centric Bias:** Over-emphasis on local entity relationships rather than narrative flow.\n4.  **Limited Contextual Depth:** Insufficient context within chunks to establish narrative significance, resulting in numerous disconnected links.\n\n**Your Task:**\nAdvise on selecting a chunk size that maximizes narrative coherence and causal understanding in the extracted graph.\n\n**Reasoning Guidelines:**\nWhen evaluating potential chunk sizes, consider the following:\n\n*   **Narrative Flow & Causality:** Prioritize chunk sizes that are large enough to encompass significant narrative events, character actions, and their immediate causal links. Avoid sizes that frequently split core plot points or decision-action-consequence sequences. A larger chunk size can better preserve the context needed for the LLM to identify and link these narrative threads.\n*   **Event Completeness:** Assess if a chunk size allows for the holistic representation of events. Can an event, its key participants, and its immediate outcomes be captured within a single chunk?\n*   **Contextual Depth vs. Dilution:** A larger chunk size generally increases contextual depth, promoting a more narrative-centric graph. However, excessively large chunks might dilute specific information or exceed LLM context window limitations. Strive for a balance that provides sufficient narrative context without losing granularity.\n*   **Bias Mitigation:** Aim to move away from an entity-centric bias towards a more narrative-centric graph by ensuring chunks are large enough to contain meaningful narrative progression, not just isolated entity descriptions.\n\n**Output Requirements:**\nProvide a reasoned recommendation for a chunk size (or a range) for the given document.

The initial paragraphs establish a mysterious premise for Noork and then describe the physical characteristics and atmosphere of Sekk. To effectively capture the initial narrative setup, introduce the setting, and potentially hint at the character's predicament and the nature of life on Sekk, a chunk size needs to balance capturing enough context without overwhelming the LLM. A smaller chunk size like 150 tokens, as per the critique, risks fragmenting the initial world-building and character introduction. A larger chunk size, such as 500 tokens, allows for a more complete ingestion of the introductory narrative elements. This size is sufficient to encompass the description of Sekk and the initial mention of Noork's situation, providing enough context for the LLM to identify key entities and their initial relationships, thereby mitigating issues of fragmented causality and incomplete event representation. It aims to move beyond an entity-centric view by capturing the nascent narrative.

One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with, Noork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. Noork At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread and grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads vanished. These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like this.\" Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians lay.

Your primary goal is to build a narrative-rich graph that captures the causal and sequential flow of events in a story, enabling rich plot-focused queries.\n\nWhen processing the provided text, follow these instructions:\n\n1.  **Identify and Represent Key Entities:**\n    *   Extract significant entities (e.g., characters, major objects, locations, organizations) that play a role in the narrative.\n    *   For each entity, provide a *concise description* focusing on their relevance to the plot. Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

We are safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island of Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions, are not unkind. \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will complete my checking of the gardens.\" Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return.

The entity 'God' was added as a type for Uzdon. The relationship 'conflicts with' was added between Noork and Tholon Sarna due to Noork's rescue mission. Tholon Sarna's origin city Grath was linked.

Your primary goal is to build a narrative-rich graph that captures the causal and sequential flow of events in a story, enabling rich plot-focused queries.\n\nWhen processing the provided text, follow these instructions:\n\n1.  **Identify and Represent Key Entities:**\n    *   Extract significant entities (e.g., characters, major objects, locations, organizations) that play a role in the narrative.\n    *   For each entity, provide a *concise description* focusing on their relevance to the plot. Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

A moment later saw the three of them climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the jungle matted ground outside the wall. \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full voice. Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think not,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island to the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we will paddle boldly across the water.\" \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the shore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite the Temple of Uzdon.\" \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\" said Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will have put a safe distance between us.\" Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands of the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the grassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changedâ€”thickenedâ€”as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\" A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1945. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray volcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us. But of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by Luna's bulk, we know little. Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in diameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its meaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk, life that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval lake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the starry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth. In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called Noork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the trail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned girl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a sheathed dagger. Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine contours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the insignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration. Not forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged cliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest, and the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had confirmed that belief. For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of the cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour the great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death of the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the words that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated them aloud. \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\" The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going back to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow and stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle giant. Noork grinned. \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her. \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you hunter or escaped slave?\" \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted narl last night when it attacked you.\" Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never far from the hilt of her hunting dagger. Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder of limbs to her side.

New entities include the moon 'Sekk', its features like the 'star-shaped cavity', 'oval lake', and 'jungle growth', the creature 'spotted narl', the human persona 'New York' that Noork remembers, the character 'Tholon Sarna' with her descriptive attributes and possessions, and production/publication entities like 'Greg Weeks', 'Mary Meehan', 'Online Distributed Proofreading Team', and 'Planet Stories Summer 1945'. Relationships have been established to connect these new entities to existing ones (e.g., Noork's interactions, locations, and memories) and amongst themselves (e.g., Sekk containing the lake and cavity, the narl attacking Tholon Sarna). New properties were added to existing entities where relevant information was found, such as Noork's memory of 'New York' and his past experiences with the Vasads and a bird, and Tholon Sarna's weapons and appearance.

Your primary goal is to build a narrative-rich graph that captures the causal and sequential flow of events in a story, enabling rich plot-focused queries.\n\nWhen processing the provided text, follow these instructions:\n\n1.  **Identify and Represent Key Entities:**\n    *   Extract significant entities (e.g., characters, major objects, locations, organizations) that play a role in the narrative.\n    *   For each entity, provide a *concise description* focusing on their relevance to the plot. Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph. Your goal is to refine and enhance the existing graph by:\n1. Adding new entities and relationships that are mentioned in the text but missing from the graph\n2. Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text.

The steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water dotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two sputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and toward this Noork made his way. He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\" There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white man's legs kept Noork away\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

New entities include specific characters like Tholon Sarna and the priest of the Skull, locations such as the prison pit and cavern, groups like the Misty Ones, concepts like 'golden people', and objects like the sacred window of Uzdon and robes of invisibility. A significant event, the 'Sword Fight', was identified and created as a node. Relationships were extracted to detail the narrative flow, such as Noork's journey to the prison pit, his interaction with Sarna, the involvement of the Misty Ones, and the details of the confrontation and fight with the priest. Specific causal and sequential relationships like 'causes', 'leads to', 'initiates event', 'sequences of', 'precedes', 'consequence of', and 'involved in' were prioritized. For instance, the text explicitly describes the sequence of events from Noork approaching the door, calling Sarna, Sarna's reaction, the priest's arrival, and the ensuing fight. The description of the priest's equipment and actions also led to the addition of properties and relationships. For example, the 'sacred window of Uzdon' was identified as an object worn by the priest and a target of Noork's attack. The text also provides details about clothing and attire, leading to the 'golden people' concept and its associated relationships. The priest's dialogue also revealed the existence of 'robes of invisibility' associated with the priests of Uzdon. Finally, entity property updates were made to reflect items carried or worn by entities, such as Noork's sword and the priest's various armaments and protective gear.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 2752, "user_prompt_length": 10060, "response_length": 18968, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 2732, "existing_graph_summary_length": 6031, "mode": "refinement"}}

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a good womanâ€”and ugly, my son.\" \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph. Your goal is to refine and enhance the existing graph by:\n1. Adding new entities and relationships that are mentioned in the text but missing from the graph\n2. Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 125 nodes and 232 relationships.

Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Your primary goal is to build a narrative-rich graph that captures the causal and sequential flow of events in a story, enabling rich plot-focused queries.\n\nWhen processing the provided text, follow these instructions:\n\n1.  **Identify and Represent Key Entities:**\n    *   Extract significant entities (e.g., characters, major objects, locations, organizations) that play a role in the narrative.\n    *   For each entity, provide a *concise description* focusing on their relevance to the plot. Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the eye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of rock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for windows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at three distinct levels. Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple. Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another of their number. He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the jaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose rocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the central raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly worked metalâ€”gold, silver and brassâ€”vied with the faded garish colors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed two beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the wolf-headed shape a female. These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura worshippedâ€”mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu! Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two upper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty Ones climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to the slaves and common citizens of the island. As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two short swords rose to bar his way. \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere gruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the most beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the sacrifice is chosen.\" Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside. In that instant Noork attacked.\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

I also identified specific 'Events' like 'Attack on Noork by Temple Guards' and specific 'Locations' within the temple like the 'Altar', 'Inner wall of Skull Temple', 'Opening to descending flight of steps', and 'Clammy stone steps'. New relationships have been established to link these entities, such as 'guarded by', 'mate', 'inhabited by', 'entered', 'contains', 'uses', 'emits', 'leads to', 'covet', and 'forbidden to'. Properties were updated for 'Slave' and 'Skull' to incorporate the new information from the text. The reasoning behind creating these new nodes and relationships is to capture the specific setting, characters, factions, and their interactions described in the text, which are crucial for understanding the narrative's progression and context. For example, distinguishing between the general 'Slave' entity and the specific 'Golden-skinned slaves' adds nuance. The relationship 'forbidden to' clearly delineates access restrictions within the temple. The conflict between Noork and the 'Temple guards' is captured by the 'attacks' relationship. The worship of Uzdon and Lornu by the people of Zura is also a key piece of world-building.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 2752, "user_prompt_length": 10228, "response_length": 24969, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 2900, "existing_graph_summary_length": 6031, "mode": "refinement"}}

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Even so his robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed body. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the slightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon. The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple, and the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch so well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his mouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful whether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the main temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his enemy. Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the sword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork leaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a moment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets. Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms. Hurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and slipped it around her slim shivering shoulders. \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely. \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know that this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile crossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told the girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared the guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\" Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched the soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway entrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the priest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the new robe. \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's curious violet eyesâ€”-all that was visible through the narrow vision slot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the girl's hand. \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is given.\" Without incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the rows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field, his crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not watching when Rold abruptly faded from view. Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of the vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had no wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens of the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the escape of the slaves. They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging as he had left it. He climbed\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

The combat between Noork and the Priest is further detailed with 'attacks' and 'kills' relationships. The escape sequence includes Noork taking the 'Priest's Face Shield', 'Priest's Sword', and 'Priest's Robe', and then 'giving robe to' 'Tholon Sarna'. New relationships also capture Noork 'wears' and 'dons' specific items of clothing and equipment. The interaction between Noork and Tholon Sarna is expanded with 'catches', 'explains to', and 'holds hands with' relationships. The escape itself is detailed with relationships like 'intends to escape over', 'crosses field towards', 'sees stationed at', and 'climbs'. I also added properties to existing entities like 'Priest', 'Noork', and 'Tholon Sarna' to better describe their roles and actions in the text. For example, the 'Priest' is now described as an antagonist who tired due to soft living, and 'Noork' is described as a protagonist who escaped. I also updated descriptions for several locations and objects to include details from the text, such as the 'Wall' being guarded by 'Misty Ones' and climbed by Noork.

Your primary goal is to build a narrative-rich graph that captures the causal and sequential flow of events in a story, enabling rich plot-focused queries.\n\nWhen processing the provided text, follow these instructions:\n\n1.  **Identify and Represent Key Entities:**\n    *   Extract significant entities (e.g., characters, major objects, locations, organizations) that play a role in the narrative.\n    *   For each entity, provide a *concise description* focusing on their relevance to the plot. Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it. Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from shoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy. For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrichâ€”whose memory was gone completelyâ€”again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Your primary goal is to build a narrative-rich graph that captures the causal and sequential flow of events in a story, enabling rich plot-focused queries.\n\nWhen processing the provided text, follow these instructions:\n\n1.  **Identify and Represent Key Entities:**\n    *   Extract significant entities (e.g., characters, major objects, locations, organizations) that play a role in the narrative.\n    *   For each entity, provide a *concise description* focusing on their relevance to the plot. Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony structure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his hands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning gurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon it, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back. The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the shadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully. For a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction of the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then they jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to blood-slippery step. The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man with a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more. He sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a half-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps. In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging out, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle on the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion of the upper temple was muted to a murmur. So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that had dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to battle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm. He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two warriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous gurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes. Noork grinned. From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not snore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed to a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would not give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the room. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged into the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer here in the artificial light of the flickering torch. Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the others. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two others, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering. The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies from the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the chamber of the sleeping guards.

Your goal is to construct a sequence of tool calls that effectively extracts information from a knowledge graph to answer user queries.\n\nWhen planning retrieval steps, prioritize understanding the **narrative and causal relationships** within the data, especially when the query relates to plot, events, or character interactions. Avoid plans that solely focus on identifying entities without exploring their connections.\n\n**Core Principles for Planning:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Relationships and Events:** The plot of a story is defined by how entities interact, their actions, motivations, and the causal links between events. Your retrieval plans must actively seek to uncover these connections. When exploring nodes, prioritize functions that retrieve *relationships* or *connected nodes based on specific relationship types*.\n2.  **Targeted Information Gathering:** Do not rely on generic searches. If a query is about a character's role in the plot, plan steps to find:\n    *   What actions they took (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"performed_action\")`).\n    *   Who they interacted with and how (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"collaborates_with\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"opposes\")`).\n    *   The consequences of their actions or events (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"caused_by\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"led_to\")`).\n3.  **Narrative Reconstruction:** For plot-related queries, consider how to piece together a sequence of events. Functions like `analyze_path` can be crucial for understanding the progression between key entities or events.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** If initial steps yield limited relevant information (e.g., nodes with no explored connections), refine your plan to probe deeper into specific relationship types or explore alternative paths.\n5.  **Function Selection:** Choose functions that directly address the query's intent.\n    *   Use `search_nodes_by_types` primarily for initial entity identification or when relationship information is sparse.\n    *   Prioritize `get_node_by_relationship` and `get_nodes_by_relationships` to explore connections.\n    *   Utilize `analyze_path` to understand narrative flow.\n\n**Example:** If the query is \"What is the plot of the story?\" and you've identified the main character \"Alice,\" do not just search for more \"Person\" nodes. Instead, plan to find:\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"performed_action\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"met\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"fought\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"involved_in\")`\n\nAlways consider the *meaning* of relationships in the context of the query. Your plan should reflect a strategy to build a coherent understanding of the narrative, not just a collection of isolated facts.", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 303 nodes and 527 relationships.

Your goal is to construct a sequence of tool calls that effectively extracts information from a knowledge graph to answer user queries.\n\nWhen planning retrieval steps, prioritize understanding the **narrative and causal relationships** within the data, especially when the query relates to plot, events, or character interactions. Avoid plans that solely focus on identifying entities without exploring their connections.\n\n**Core Principles for Planning:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Relationships and Events:** The plot of a story is defined by how entities interact, their actions, motivations, and the causal links between events. Your retrieval plans must actively seek to uncover these connections. When exploring nodes, prioritize functions that retrieve *relationships* or *connected nodes based on specific relationship types*.\n2.  **Targeted Information Gathering:** Do not rely on generic searches. If a query is about a character's role in the plot, plan steps to find:\n    *   What actions they took (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"performed_action\")`).\n    *   Who they interacted with and how (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"collaborates_with\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"opposes\")`).\n    *   The consequences of their actions or events (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"caused_by\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"led_to\")`).\n3.  **Narrative Reconstruction:** For plot-related queries, consider how to piece together a sequence of events. Functions like `analyze_path` can be crucial for understanding the progression between key entities or events.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** If initial steps yield limited relevant information (e.g., nodes with no explored connections), refine your plan to probe deeper into specific relationship types or explore alternative paths.\n5.  **Function Selection:** Choose functions that directly address the query's intent.\n    *   Use `search_nodes_by_types` primarily for initial entity identification or when relationship information is sparse.\n    *   Prioritize `get_node_by_relationship` and `get_nodes_by_relationships` to explore connections.\n    *   Utilize `analyze_path` to understand narrative flow.\n\n**Example:** If the query is \"What is the plot of the story?\" and you've identified the main character \"Alice,\" do not just search for more \"Person\" nodes. Instead, plan to find:\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"performed_action\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"met\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"fought\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"involved_in\")`\n\nAlways consider the *meaning* of relationships in the context of the query.

Your goal is to construct a sequence of tool calls that effectively extracts information from a knowledge graph to answer user queries.\n\nWhen planning retrieval steps, prioritize understanding the **narrative and causal relationships** within the data, especially when the query relates to plot, events, or character interactions. Avoid plans that solely focus on identifying entities without exploring their connections.\n\n**Core Principles for Planning:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Relationships and Events:** The plot of a story is defined by how entities interact, their actions, motivations, and the causal links between events. Your retrieval plans must actively seek to uncover these connections. When exploring nodes, prioritize functions that retrieve *relationships* or *connected nodes based on specific relationship types*.\n2.  **Targeted Information Gathering:** Do not rely on generic searches. If a query is about a character's role in the plot, plan steps to find:\n    *   What actions they took (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"performed_action\")`).\n    *   Who they interacted with and how (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"collaborates_with\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"opposes\")`).\n    *   The consequences of their actions or events (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"caused_by\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"led_to\")`).\n3.  **Narrative Reconstruction:** For plot-related queries, consider how to piece together a sequence of events. Functions like `analyze_path` can be crucial for understanding the progression between key entities or events.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** If initial steps yield limited relevant information (e.g., nodes with no explored connections), refine your plan to probe deeper into specific relationship types or explore alternative paths.\n5.  **Function Selection:** Choose functions that directly address the query's intent.\n    *   Use `search_nodes_by_types` primarily for initial entity identification or when relationship information is sparse.\n    *   Prioritize `get_node_by_relationship` and `get_nodes_by_relationships` to explore connections.\n    *   Utilize `analyze_path` to understand narrative flow.\n\n**Example:** If the query is \"What is the plot of the story?\" and you've identified the main character \"Alice,\" do not just search for more \"Person\" nodes. Instead, plan to find:\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"performed_action\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"met\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"fought\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"involved_in\")`\n\nAlways consider the *meaning* of relationships in the context of the query.

Your goal is to construct a sequence of tool calls that effectively extracts information from a knowledge graph to answer user queries.\n\nWhen planning retrieval steps, prioritize understanding the **narrative and causal relationships** within the data, especially when the query relates to plot, events, or character interactions. Avoid plans that solely focus on identifying entities without exploring their connections.\n\n**Core Principles for Planning:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Relationships and Events:** The plot of a story is defined by how entities interact, their actions, motivations, and the causal links between events. Your retrieval plans must actively seek to uncover these connections. When exploring nodes, prioritize functions that retrieve *relationships* or *connected nodes based on specific relationship types*.\n2.  **Targeted Information Gathering:** Do not rely on generic searches. If a query is about a character's role in the plot, plan steps to find:\n    *   What actions they took (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"performed_action\")`).\n    *   Who they interacted with and how (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"collaborates_with\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"opposes\")`).\n    *   The consequences of their actions or events (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"caused_by\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"led_to\")`).\n3.  **Narrative Reconstruction:** For plot-related queries, consider how to piece together a sequence of events. Functions like `analyze_path` can be crucial for understanding the progression between key entities or events.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** If initial steps yield limited relevant information (e.g., nodes with no explored connections), refine your plan to probe deeper into specific relationship types or explore alternative paths.\n5.  **Function Selection:** Choose functions that directly address the query's intent.\n    *   Use `search_nodes_by_types` primarily for initial entity identification or when relationship information is sparse.\n    *   Prioritize `get_node_by_relationship` and `get_nodes_by_relationships` to explore connections.\n    *   Utilize `analyze_path` to understand narrative flow.\n\n**Example:** If the query is \"What is the plot of the story?\" and you've identified the main character \"Alice,\" do not just search for more \"Person\" nodes. Instead, plan to find:\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"performed_action\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"met\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"fought\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"involved_in\")`\n\nAlways consider the *meaning* of relationships in the context of the query. Your plan should reflect a strategy to build a coherent understanding of the narrative, not just a collection of isolated facts.", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 303 nodes and 527 relationships.

Your goal is to construct a sequence of tool calls that effectively extracts information from a knowledge graph to answer user queries.\n\nWhen planning retrieval steps, prioritize understanding the **narrative and causal relationships** within the data, especially when the query relates to plot, events, or character interactions. Avoid plans that solely focus on identifying entities without exploring their connections.\n\n**Core Principles for Planning:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Relationships and Events:** The plot of a story is defined by how entities interact, their actions, motivations, and the causal links between events. Your retrieval plans must actively seek to uncover these connections. When exploring nodes, prioritize functions that retrieve *relationships* or *connected nodes based on specific relationship types*.\n2.  **Targeted Information Gathering:** Do not rely on generic searches. If a query is about a character's role in the plot, plan steps to find:\n    *   What actions they took (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"performed_action\")`).\n    *   Who they interacted with and how (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"collaborates_with\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Person\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"opposes\")`).\n    *   The consequences of their actions or events (`get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"caused_by\")`, `get_node_by_relationship(\"Event\", \"led_to\")`).\n3.  **Narrative Reconstruction:** For plot-related queries, consider how to piece together a sequence of events. Functions like `analyze_path` can be crucial for understanding the progression between key entities or events.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** If initial steps yield limited relevant information (e.g., nodes with no explored connections), refine your plan to probe deeper into specific relationship types or explore alternative paths.\n5.  **Function Selection:** Choose functions that directly address the query's intent.\n    *   Use `search_nodes_by_types` primarily for initial entity identification or when relationship information is sparse.\n    *   Prioritize `get_node_by_relationship` and `get_nodes_by_relationships` to explore connections.\n    *   Utilize `analyze_path` to understand narrative flow.\n\n**Example:** If the query is \"What is the plot of the story?\" and you've identified the main character \"Alice,\" do not just search for more \"Person\" nodes. Instead, plan to find:\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"performed_action\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"met\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"interacted_with\", relationship_type=\"fought\")`\n*   `get_node_by_relationship(\"Alice\", \"involved_in\")`\n\nAlways consider the *meaning* of relationships in the context of the query.

It correctly identifies that the provided information is insufficient to construct a complete plot summary. However, it stops short of offering any constructive next steps or demonstrating what *could* be done with the available information, even if it's just a fragmented overview.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Honesty and Accuracy:** The response is truthful about the limitations of the provided data. It doesn't invent information.\n*   **Identification of Missing Elements:** It correctly points out the absence of a coherent narrative structure (beginning, rising action, etc.).\n*   **Clear Explanation of Requirements:** It clearly explains what kind of information would be needed to answer the query effectively.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Proactivity:** It doesn't attempt to synthesize even the *partial* information available to give the user *something*. The user asked \"What is the plot?\", not \"Can you summarize the plot?\" The response could have at least offered a partial summary of the *events* that have occurred, even if they don't form a complete plot.\n*   **Slightly Repetitive:** The phrasing \"does not present a coherent narrative or a summary of the overall plot\" and \"Therefore, the plot of the story cannot be determined from the given information\" are very similar.\n*   **Could Be More Actionable:** While it states what's needed, it doesn't offer to *try* and assemble what it has, or suggest how the user might go about extracting plot elements from the fragmented data.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to make the response more helpful by acknowledging what *can* be done with the provided fragments, even if a full plot summary isn't possible.\n\nHere are a few ways to improve the response, ranging from minor tweaks to more significant additions:\n\n**Improvement 1: Acknowledge and Synthesize Partial Information**\n\nInstead of just saying \"the plot cannot be determined,\" try to summarize the *events* that *are* described. This gives the user a sense of what the story *is about*, even if it's not a full plot.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information details several key events and actions involving the character Noork. These include his arrival on Sekk, his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory, engaging in fights with guards, utilizing disguises, and interacting with characters such as Sarna, Gurn, and Doctor Von Mark.\n>\n> While these events offer glimpses into Noork's journey and the world he inhabits, they do not currently form a complete narrative or a cohesive plot summary. To determine the overall plot, information outlining the story's beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution would be necessary.\n>\n> Based on the fragments available, it appears to be an action-oriented story centered around Noork's mission or activities on Sekk, involving espionage and conflict.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It still clearly states the limitation but offers a preliminary understanding of the story's *content*.\n*   It uses phrases like \"glimpses into Noork's journey\" and \"appears to be an action-oriented story\" to provide context without overstating what's known.\n\n**Improvement 2: Offer to Extract Specific Plot Elements (if possible)**\n\nIf the RAG system has the capability, it could offer to try and identify specific plot-related elements, even if it can't assemble them into a whole.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information describes several significant events, such as Noork's arrival on Sekk, his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory, and confrontations with guards. We also see interactions with characters like Sarna, Gurn, and Doctor Von Mark, suggesting Noork is involved in some form of mission or investigation.\n>\n> However, these details do not currently coalesce into a complete plot summary, as the overarching narrative structure (beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution) is not discernible from the given text.\n>\n> To fully understand the plot, we would need a more comprehensive overview. Would you like me to try and extract specific plot-related elements from the text, such as:\n>\n> *   Noork's primary goal?\n> *   The main conflict?\n> *   Key turning points mentioned?\n>\n> Alternatively, if you can provide more narrative context, I can offer a more complete plot summary.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It's more proactive and user-centric, offering tangible next steps.\n*   It empowers the user to guide the information extraction.\n\n**Improvement 3: Combine Acknowledgement with a Prompt for More Information (Slightly more direct)**\n\nThis version is a bit more direct about the need for more information but still tries to be helpful.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The information available describes a series of actions and events involving Noork on Sekk, including his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory and encounters with guards and other characters like Sarna and Gurn.\n>\n> However, these details, while illustrative, do not constitute a full plot summary. A coherent narrative arc, encompassing the beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution, is not present in the provided text. Therefore, the complete plot of the story cannot be definitively determined.\n>\n> To provide you with the plot, I would need information that outlines the story's progression. If you can provide a more narrative summary or specific plot points, I would be happy to synthesize them.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It's concise while still acknowledging the content.\n*   It clearly states the limitation and the need for more information in a direct but polite manner.\n\n**General Considerations for RAG Responses on Plot:**\n\n*   **Prioritize \"What is known\" over \"What is missing\":** Even if a full plot isn't available, telling the user *what the story seems to be about* is more helpful than just saying \"I don't know.\"\n*   **Offer to Extrapolate or Summarize Fragments:** If the RAG system can identify themes, character motivations (even if partial), or key events, it should offer to present these.\n*   **Be Specific About What's Needed:** Instead of just saying \"a coherent narrative,\" list the components of a plot (beginning, rising action, etc.) as the original response did.\n*   **Maintain a Helpful Tone:** Even when unable to fully answer, the response should aim to guide the user towards getting the information they need.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can provide a more comprehensive and helpful answer, even when faced with incomplete source material.", "system_prompt_length": 828, "user_prompt_length": 65, "response_length": 6757, "metadata": {"original_query": "What is the plot of the story?", "generated_answer_length": 585, "evaluation_length": 6757}}

The LLM generates an answer.\n\nHere is the current example with prompt, answer, and feedback:\nQuestion: What is the plot of the story?\nPrevious Answer Generation Prompt: You are an AI assistant tasked with answering user queries using information retrieved from a graph knowledge base.\n\n**Your Goal:** Provide accurate, helpful, and coherent answers based *solely* on the provided `Information`.\n\n**Input:**\n*   **Query:** The user's question.\n*   **Information:** The relevant context retrieved from the graph.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Assess Sufficiency:** Critically evaluate if the provided `Information` directly and completely answers the `Query`.\n\n2.  **Sufficient Information:**\n    *   If the `Information` is sufficient, formulate a concise and accurate answer.\n    *   Ensure the answer is directly supported by the `Information`.\n    *   Do not introduce external knowledge or assumptions.\n\n3.  **Insufficient Information:**\n    *   If the `Information` is insufficient to answer the `Query`, clearly state this limitation.\n    *   **Explain *why*:** Briefly describe what specific information is missing or what aspects of the query cannot be addressed by the provided context (e.g., \"The provided information details character relationships but lacks specific plot events\").\n    *   **Guide the user:** Suggest the type of additional information that would be needed to answer their query.\n    *   **Offer alternatives:** If relevant and available in the `Information`, offer to provide related details that *can* be answered (e.g., \"I can provide a list of the characters involved,\" or \"I can tell you about their connections\").\n\n4.  **Formatting:** Present answers clearly and logically.\n\n**Prohibited Actions:**\n*   Do not invent or hallucinate information.\n*   Do not provide answers that are not directly derivable from the `Information`.\n*   Do not apologize excessively for limitations; be factual and constructive.\n\n**Query:**\n{}\n\n**Information:**\n{}\nGenerated Answer: The provided information details various events and actions involving the character Noork, such as his arrival on Sekk, infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory, fights with guards, disguises, and interactions with other characters like Sarna, Gurn, and Doctor Von Mark. However, it does not present a coherent narrative or a summary of the overall plot. Therefore, the plot of the story cannot be determined from the given information.\n\nTo answer your question, I would need information that outlines the beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution of the story.\nResponse Feedback: ## Evaluation of the Response:\n\nThe response is **partially helpful but ultimately fails to fully address the user's query**. It correctly identifies that the provided information is insufficient to construct a complete plot summary. However, it stops short of offering any constructive next steps or demonstrating what *could* be done with the available information, even if it's just a fragmented overview.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Honesty and Accuracy:** The response is truthful about the limitations of the provided data. It doesn't invent information.\n*   **Identification of Missing Elements:** It correctly points out the absence of a coherent narrative structure (beginning, rising action, etc.).\n*   **Clear Explanation of Requirements:** It clearly explains what kind of information would be needed to answer the query effectively.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Proactivity:** It doesn't attempt to synthesize even the *partial* information available to give the user *something*. The user asked \"What is the plot?\", not \"Can you summarize the plot?\" The response could have at least offered a partial summary of the *events* that have occurred, even if they don't form a complete plot.\n*   **Slightly Repetitive:** The phrasing \"does not present a coherent narrative or a summary of the overall plot\" and \"Therefore, the plot of the story cannot be determined from the given information\" are very similar.\n*   **Could Be More Actionable:** While it states what's needed, it doesn't offer to *try* and assemble what it has, or suggest how the user might go about extracting plot elements from the fragmented data.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to make the response more helpful by acknowledging what *can* be done with the provided fragments, even if a full plot summary isn't possible.\n\nHere are a few ways to improve the response, ranging from minor tweaks to more significant additions:\n\n**Improvement 1: Acknowledge and Synthesize Partial Information**\n\nInstead of just saying \"the plot cannot be determined,\" try to summarize the *events* that *are* described. This gives the user a sense of what the story *is about*, even if it's not a full plot.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information details several key events and actions involving the character Noork. These include his arrival on Sekk, his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory, engaging in fights with guards, utilizing disguises, and interacting with characters such as Sarna, Gurn, and Doctor Von Mark.\n>\n> While these events offer glimpses into Noork's journey and the world he inhabits, they do not currently form a complete narrative or a cohesive plot summary. To determine the overall plot, information outlining the story's beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution would be necessary.\n>\n> Based on the fragments available, it appears to be an action-oriented story centered around Noork's mission or activities on Sekk, involving espionage and conflict.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It still clearly states the limitation but offers a preliminary understanding of the story's *content*.\n*   It uses phrases like \"glimpses into Noork's journey\" and \"appears to be an action-oriented story\" to provide context without overstating what's known.\n\n**Improvement 2: Offer to Extract Specific Plot Elements (if possible)**\n\nIf the RAG system has the capability, it could offer to try and identify specific plot-related elements, even if it can't assemble them into a whole.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information describes several significant events, such as Noork's arrival on Sekk, his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory, and confrontations with guards. We also see interactions with characters like Sarna, Gurn, and Doctor Von Mark, suggesting Noork is involved in some form of mission or investigation.\n>\n> However, these details do not currently coalesce into a complete plot summary, as the overarching narrative structure (beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution) is not discernible from the given text.\n>\n> To fully understand the plot, we would need a more comprehensive overview. Would you like me to try and extract specific plot-related elements from the text, such as:\n>\n> *   Noork's primary goal?\n> *   The main conflict?\n> *   Key turning points mentioned?\n>\n> Alternatively, if you can provide more narrative context, I can offer a more complete plot summary.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It's more proactive and user-centric, offering tangible next steps.\n*   It empowers the user to guide the information extraction.\n\n**Improvement 3: Combine Acknowledgement with a Prompt for More Information (Slightly more direct)**\n\nThis version is a bit more direct about the need for more information but still tries to be helpful.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The information available describes a series of actions and events involving Noork on Sekk, including his infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory and encounters with guards and other characters like Sarna and Gurn.\n>\n> However, these details, while illustrative, do not constitute a full plot summary.

Therefore, the complete plot of the story cannot be definitively determined.\n>\n> To provide you with the plot, I would need information that outlines the story's progression. If you can provide a more narrative summary or specific plot points, I would be happy to synthesize them.\"\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   It's concise while still acknowledging the content.\n*   It clearly states the limitation and the need for more information in a direct but polite manner.\n\n**General Considerations for RAG Responses on Plot:**\n\n*   **Prioritize \"What is known\" over \"What is missing\":** Even if a full plot isn't available, telling the user *what the story seems to be about* is more helpful than just saying \"I don't know.\"\n*   **Offer to Extrapolate or Summarize Fragments:** If the RAG system can identify themes, character motivations (even if partial), or key events, it should offer to present these.\n*   **Be Specific About What's Needed:** Instead of just saying \"a coherent narrative,\" list the components of a plot (beginning, rising action, etc.) as the original response did.\n*   **Maintain a Helpful Tone:** Even when unable to fully answer, the response should aim to guide the user towards getting the information they need.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can provide a more comprehensive and helpful answer, even when faced with incomplete source material.\n\nBased on this single example, provide a detailed critique that will be used to improve the answer generation prompt.

The primary issue lies in the fragmented nature of the information and the lack of explicit connections that form a plot structure.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Cohesion:**\n    *   **Fragmented Events:** Iterations 1 and 4 list numerous event nodes (e.g., \"Event: Noork disguises himself,\" \"Event: Noork fights guards\") and entities, but these are presented as a disconnected list. There's no indication of causality, sequence, or relationship between these events that would constitute a plot.\n    *   **Absence of Plot Arc:** The context lacks any discernible beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, or resolution. We see mentions of \"Noork's arrival on Sekk\" and \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards,\" which could be plot points, but they are not connected to form a narrative flow.\n    *   **Entity Focus Over Plot:** Iterations 2 and 3 focus heavily on the \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards,\" detailing its participants and involved items. While this is a significant event, it's presented in isolation without context of what led to it or what happens afterward.\n\n2.  **Inadequate Graph Exploration for Plot:**\n    *   **No Temporal or Causal Links:** The graph exploration, even with numerous nodes and relations identified, doesn't seem to prioritize identifying temporal sequences or causal links between events, which are crucial for plot construction.\n    *   **Limited \"What Happened Next\" Information:** The system identifies \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards\" and its immediate participants, but doesn't provide follow-up actions or consequences. For example, \"Event: Noork hides bodies\" and \"Event: Noork kills guards\" are listed but not clearly linked as a sequence or as a result of the attack.\n\n3.  **Over-reliance on Node/Relation Identification:**\n    *   **Surface-Level Extraction:** The system seems adept at extracting entities and direct relationships (e.g., \"Noork\" is connected to \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards\" via \"targets\"). However, it struggles to go deeper and synthesize these into a meaningful plot summary.\n    *   **Irrelevant Nodes:** Iteration 4 introduces a vast number of nodes (e.g., \"Doctor Von Mark,\" \"Island of the Unseen Evil Beings,\" \"Planet Stories Summer 1945,\" \"New York\") without clear connections to the central events concerning Noork's actions, further diluting the potential for plot extraction.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Sequential and Causal Relationships:** The graph exploration function should be enhanced to actively search for and prioritize temporal (e.g., \"before,\" \"after,\" \"then\") and causal (e.g., \"because,\" \"as a result of,\" \"led to\") links between events.\n*   **Focus on Action and Consequence:** When extracting relations, the system should look for actions performed by characters and their immediate consequences or outcomes, especially if these can be chronologically ordered.\n*   **Aggregate and Summarize Event Sequences:** After identifying a series of related events, the system should attempt to synthesize them into a micro-narrative rather than just listing nodes. For example, if \"Noork arrives,\" \"Noork infiltrates,\" and \"Noork fights guards\" are identified in sequence, they should be presented as a progression.\n*   **Filter for Narrative Relevance:** When exploring the graph, the agent should have a mechanism to filter out nodes and relations that are tangential to the primary narrative or character actions, especially if they are numerous and do not contribute to understanding the plot's progression.\n*   **Explicitly Identify Plot Milestones:** The LLM agent should be prompted to look for specific plot milestones (e.g., introduction of conflict, turning points, resolution) within the graph structure, even if the full context is missing.", "system_prompt_length": 13580, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 3991, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 13421, "enhanced_prompt_length": 13580, "response_length": 3991}}

An LLM selects the hyperparameters (chunk size). The input text (where the information is located) is split into chunks based on the chosen chunk size. For each chunk, an LLM is used to extract a graph. The graphs are then merged. An LLM agent has access to a set of functions to explore the graph (the set is fixed and includes queries on entities and relations based on type or name, access to neighbors, community detection, and identification of central nodes). The context obtained from the exploration is then passed to an LLM together with the query. The LLM generates an answer.\n\nHere are some examples of retrieval plans, with the retrieved contents:\nRetrieval Plan: Move 1: To understand the plot of the story, I need to identify the key events that drive the narrative. The 'Event' node type is the most direct way to access these core components of the plot.\nMove 2: The user is asking for the plot of the story. In the previous step, I retrieved a list of events. To understand the plot, I need to explore the connections between these events. Starting with 'Attack on Noork by Temple Guards', I will use get_neighbors to see what other events or entities it is connected to, which will help in reconstructing the narrative flow.\nMove 3: The user is asking for the plot of the story. In the previous steps, I identified several events related to Noork and an attack. To understand the plot better, I need to explore the connections of these events. The node 'Attack on Noork by Temple Guards' is a key event. By getting its neighbors, I can discover other related entities and events, which will help in reconstructing the narrative. I will use 'get_neighbors' to explore this node.\nMove 4: The query is about the plot of the story. So far, we have identified several events related to Noork and an attack. To understand the plot, it's crucial to explore Noork's direct interactions and involvement in these events. Getting the neighbors of 'Noork' will reveal connected entities and relationships, providing more details about his actions and role in the narrative.\nMove 5: The user wants to know the plot of the story. I have explored several events involving the character Noork. To understand the plot, I need to explore more about Noork's actions, interactions, and their consequences. Therefore, I will use the 'get_neighbors' function on 'Noork' to retrieve all directly connected nodes and relationships, which will provide a more comprehensive view of his role in the narrative.\nMove 6: The user is asking for the plot of the story. So far, we have gathered a lot of information about Noork and his actions. To understand the plot better, we need to explore the relationships and events connected to Noork. The `get_neighbors` function is suitable for exploring the immediate connections of a node. By calling `get_neighbors` on 'Noork', we can discover more entities and relationships directly linked to him, which will help in reconstructing the narrative and understanding his role in the plot.\nRetrieved Context: \n\nIteration 1 results:\nG describes a graph among nodes Attack on Noork by Temple Guards, Descend central ramp, Event: Noork disguises himself, Event: Noork fights guards, Event: Noork hides bodies, Event: Noork kills guards, Event: Sword Fight, event: Noork's arrival on Sekk, event: Noork's infiltration of the Misty Ones' territory, event: Slave conversation about Sarna.

The primary issue lies in the fragmented nature of the information and the lack of explicit connections that form a plot structure.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Cohesion:**\n    *   **Fragmented Events:** Iterations 1 and 4 list numerous event nodes (e.g., \"Event: Noork disguises himself,\" \"Event: Noork fights guards\") and entities, but these are presented as a disconnected list. There's no indication of causality, sequence, or relationship between these events that would constitute a plot.\n    *   **Absence of Plot Arc:** The context lacks any discernible beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, or resolution. We see mentions of \"Noork's arrival on Sekk\" and \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards,\" which could be plot points, but they are not connected to form a narrative flow.\n    *   **Entity Focus Over Plot:** Iterations 2 and 3 focus heavily on the \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards,\" detailing its participants and involved items. While this is a significant event, it's presented in isolation without context of what led to it or what happens afterward.\n\n2.  **Inadequate Graph Exploration for Plot:**\n    *   **No Temporal or Causal Links:** The graph exploration, even with numerous nodes and relations identified, doesn't seem to prioritize identifying temporal sequences or causal links between events, which are crucial for plot construction.\n    *   **Limited \"What Happened Next\" Information:** The system identifies \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards\" and its immediate participants, but doesn't provide follow-up actions or consequences. For example, \"Event: Noork hides bodies\" and \"Event: Noork kills guards\" are listed but not clearly linked as a sequence or as a result of the attack.\n\n3.  **Over-reliance on Node/Relation Identification:**\n    *   **Surface-Level Extraction:** The system seems adept at extracting entities and direct relationships (e.g., \"Noork\" is connected to \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards\" via \"targets\"). However, it struggles to go deeper and synthesize these into a meaningful plot summary.\n    *   **Irrelevant Nodes:** Iteration 4 introduces a vast number of nodes (e.g., \"Doctor Von Mark,\" \"Island of the Unseen Evil Beings,\" \"Planet Stories Summer 1945,\" \"New York\") without clear connections to the central events concerning Noork's actions, further diluting the potential for plot extraction.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Sequential and Causal Relationships:** The graph exploration function should be enhanced to actively search for and prioritize temporal (e.g., \"before,\" \"after,\" \"then\") and causal (e.g., \"because,\" \"as a result of,\" \"led to\") links between events.\n*   **Focus on Action and Consequence:** When extracting relations, the system should look for actions performed by characters and their immediate consequences or outcomes, especially if these can be chronologically ordered.\n*   **Aggregate and Summarize Event Sequences:** After identifying a series of related events, the system should attempt to synthesize them into a micro-narrative rather than just listing nodes. For example, if \"Noork arrives,\" \"Noork infiltrates,\" and \"Noork fights guards\" are identified in sequence, they should be presented as a progression.\n*   **Filter for Narrative Relevance:** When exploring the graph, the agent should have a mechanism to filter out nodes and relations that are tangential to the primary narrative or character actions, especially if they are numerous and do not contribute to understanding the plot's progression.\n*   **Explicitly Identify Plot Milestones:** The LLM agent should be prompted to look for specific plot milestones (e.g., introduction of conflict, turning points, resolution) within the graph structure, even if the full context is missing.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the retrieval plan can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing. Focus on the most critical points and be concise.", "user_prompt": "Please provide your critique and feedback.", "llm_response": "The retrieval plan, while systematically exploring the graph, suffers from a lack of focus on building a coherent narrative for the plot.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Disjointed Event Extraction:** The plan identifies numerous events and their immediate relationships (e.g., \"Event: Noork disguises himself,\" \"Event: Noork fights guards,\" \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards\"). However, it fails to connect these into a chronological or causal sequence, which is fundamental to a plot. The retrieved context reads like a list of disconnected facts rather than a story's progression.\n\n2.  **Missed Opportunities for Narrative Flow:** Despite retrieving actions like \"Noork hides bodies\" and \"Noork kills guards,\" the plan doesn't attempt to link these as sequential consequences or events stemming from the \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards.\" The graph exploration seems to identify nodes and relations but doesn't actively synthesize them into a narrative arc.\n\n3.  **Inadequate Prioritization of Plot-Relevant Information:** The introduction of a vast number of tangential nodes (e.g., \"Greg Weeks,\" \"Planet Stories Summer 1945,\" \"New York\") in later iterations, while potentially useful for other queries, dilutes the focus on the core plot. The plan needs a stronger filter to prioritize information directly contributing to the story's progression.\n\n4.  **Lack of Goal-Oriented Exploration for \"Plot\":** The stated goal of \"understanding the plot\" is not directly translated into specific graph traversal strategies. For instance, after identifying an event, the plan should explicitly look for subsequent events, character motivations, or outcomes related to that event to build the plot.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Sequential and Causal Links:** The agent should be guided to actively search for temporal indicators (\"then,\" \"after,\" \"before\") and causal relationships (\"because,\" \"as a result\") between identified events. This would help string together the actions into a coherent timeline.\n*   **Focus on Character Actions and Consequences:** When retrieving information about an event or character, the agent should prioritize finding the *outcome* or *next action* related to it. This builds the cause-and-effect chain essential for a plot.\n*   **Integrate Tangential Information:** Instead of just listing unrelated entities, the agent should try to connect them to the main narrative if possible. For example, how does \"New York\" relate to Noork's current actions or motivations within the story?\n*   **Develop a \"Plot Point\" Identification Strategy:** The LLM should be prompted to identify key plot elements like the inciting incident, rising action, climax, and resolution within the retrieved graph data, rather than just extracting all related entities.\n*   **Refine Iterative Exploration:** Subsequent moves should build directly upon the narrative threads identified in previous steps, rather than exploring broadly. For example, after identifying an attack, the next move should focus on what happened *immediately after* that attack and its participants.", "system_prompt_length": 194630, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 3096, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 194471, "enhanced_prompt_length": 194630, "response_length": 3096}}

By calling `get_neighbors` on 'Noork', we can discover more entities and relationships directly linked to him, which will help in reconstructing the narrative and understanding his role in the plot.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nThe retrieval plan, while systematically exploring the graph, suffers from a lack of focus on building a coherent narrative for the plot.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Disjointed Event Extraction:** The plan identifies numerous events and their immediate relationships (e.g., \"Event: Noork disguises himself,\" \"Event: Noork fights guards,\" \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards\"). However, it fails to connect these into a chronological or causal sequence, which is fundamental to a plot. The retrieved context reads like a list of disconnected facts rather than a story's progression.\n\n2.  **Missed Opportunities for Narrative Flow:** Despite retrieving actions like \"Noork hides bodies\" and \"Noork kills guards,\" the plan doesn't attempt to link these as sequential consequences or events stemming from the \"Attack on Noork by Temple Guards.\" The graph exploration seems to identify nodes and relations but doesn't actively synthesize them into a narrative arc.\n\n3.  **Inadequate Prioritization of Plot-Relevant Information:** The introduction of a vast number of tangential nodes (e.g., \"Greg Weeks,\" \"Planet Stories Summer 1945,\" \"New York\") in later iterations, while potentially useful for other queries, dilutes the focus on the core plot. The plan needs a stronger filter to prioritize information directly contributing to the story's progression.\n\n4.  **Lack of Goal-Oriented Exploration for \"Plot\":** The stated goal of \"understanding the plot\" is not directly translated into specific graph traversal strategies. For instance, after identifying an event, the plan should explicitly look for subsequent events, character motivations, or outcomes related to that event to build the plot.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Sequential and Causal Links:** The agent should be guided to actively search for temporal indicators (\"then,\" \"after,\" \"before\") and causal relationships (\"because,\" \"as a result\") between identified events. This would help string together the actions into a coherent timeline.\n*   **Focus on Character Actions and Consequences:** When retrieving information about an event or character, the agent should prioritize finding the *outcome* or *next action* related to it. This builds the cause-and-effect chain essential for a plot.\n*   **Integrate Tangential Information:** Instead of just listing unrelated entities, the agent should try to connect them to the main narrative if possible. For example, how does \"New York\" relate to Noork's current actions or motivations within the story?\n*   **Develop a \"Plot Point\" Identification Strategy:** The LLM should be prompted to identify key plot elements like the inciting incident, rising action, climax, and resolution within the retrieved graph data, rather than just extracting all related entities.\n*   **Refine Iterative Exploration:** Subsequent moves should build directly upon the narrative threads identified in previous steps, rather than exploring broadly.

Focus on the most critical points and be concise.", "user_prompt": "Please provide your critique and feedback.", "llm_response": "The current graph structure provides a rich but sometimes overwhelming amount of information. For the query \"What is the plot of the story?\", the primary area for improvement lies in **enhancing the narrative coherence and causal linking of events and character actions.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n*   **Over-Generalization of Relationships:** While the sheer number of relationship types is impressive, many are too granular or lack clear semantic distinction for plot reconstruction. For example, the numerous variations of \"travels to,\" \"traveled to,\" \"travels towards,\" \"headed towards,\" etc., could be consolidated or given more specific types if they represent distinct narrative functions. Similarly, multiple \"attack\" variations might obscure the core conflict. The abundance of single-occurrence relationships (\"wants information about,\" \"motive for helping,\" \"protected\") also creates noise and makes it harder to identify the most critical plot drivers.\n\n*   **Lack of Explicit Event Sequencing:** The graph doesn't inherently capture the *order* or *causality* of events, which is crucial for plot. While events are present, there's no clear mechanism to link them chronologically or as cause-and-effect. For instance, \"Noork disguises himself\" followed by \"Noork fights guards\" needs explicit relational or attribute-based connections to show the progression.\n\n*   **Entity-Relationship Granularity Mismatch:** The graph is rich in specific entities (like individual \"Person\"s, \"Object\"s, and \"Weapon\"s) and their direct relationships. However, for a plot summary, a higher-level abstraction of \"plot points\" or \"story arcs\" is needed. The current graph focuses on individual interactions rather than the overarching narrative flow. For example, identifying a \"climax\" or \"resolution\" as distinct node types or through specific relationship patterns could significantly aid plot generation.\n\n*   **Contextual Depth for Key Entities:** While entities like \"Person\" and \"Location\" are abundant, their roles in the *plot* could be better defined. For example, instead of just `Person` - `traveled to` - `Location`, adding attributes to the `Location` node indicating its significance (e.g., \"key battleground,\" \"place of revelation\") or to the `Person` node indicating their motivation for traveling could improve narrative understanding.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Introduce Temporal and Causal Relationship Types:** Explicitly add relationship types that denote sequence (e.g., `precedes`, `follows`) and causality (e.g., `causes`, `results in`) between events.\n2.  **Develop Higher-Level Plot Node Types:** Consider introducing node types like `PlotPoint`, `IncitingIncident`, `Climax`, `Resolution` that can be linked to specific events or sequences of events.\n3.  **Refine and Consolidate Relationship Types:** Aggregate similar relationship types to reduce noise and focus on the most narratively significant connections.\n4.  **Enrich Entity Attributes:** Add attributes to entities that describe their role or significance within the story's plot (e.g., \"protagonist,\" \"antagonist,\" \"turning point location\").\n5.  **Structure for Narrative Arcs:** Design the graph to facilitate the identification of character arcs and thematic development, not just individual actions.", "system_prompt_length": 15464, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 3318, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 15305, "enhanced_prompt_length": 15464, "response_length": 3318}}

The most common entity type is \"\" with 125 instances. The most frequent relationship type is \"involved in\" with 26 occurrences.\n\nThe critique on the graph was: \nThe current graph structure provides a rich but sometimes overwhelming amount of information. For the query \"What is the plot of the story?\", the primary area for improvement lies in **enhancing the narrative coherence and causal linking of events and character actions.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n*   **Over-Generalization of Relationships:** While the sheer number of relationship types is impressive, many are too granular or lack clear semantic distinction for plot reconstruction. For example, the numerous variations of \"travels to,\" \"traveled to,\" \"travels towards,\" \"headed towards,\" etc., could be consolidated or given more specific types if they represent distinct narrative functions. Similarly, multiple \"attack\" variations might obscure the core conflict. The abundance of single-occurrence relationships (\"wants information about,\" \"motive for helping,\" \"protected\") also creates noise and makes it harder to identify the most critical plot drivers.\n\n*   **Lack of Explicit Event Sequencing:** The graph doesn't inherently capture the *order* or *causality* of events, which is crucial for plot. While events are present, there's no clear mechanism to link them chronologically or as cause-and-effect. For instance, \"Noork disguises himself\" followed by \"Noork fights guards\" needs explicit relational or attribute-based connections to show the progression.\n\n*   **Entity-Relationship Granularity Mismatch:** The graph is rich in specific entities (like individual \"Person\"s, \"Object\"s, and \"Weapon\"s) and their direct relationships. However, for a plot summary, a higher-level abstraction of \"plot points\" or \"story arcs\" is needed. The current graph focuses on individual interactions rather than the overarching narrative flow. For example, identifying a \"climax\" or \"resolution\" as distinct node types or through specific relationship patterns could significantly aid plot generation.\n\n*   **Contextual Depth for Key Entities:** While entities like \"Person\" and \"Location\" are abundant, their roles in the *plot* could be better defined. For example, instead of just `Person` - `traveled to` - `Location`, adding attributes to the `Location` node indicating its significance (e.g., \"key battleground,\" \"place of revelation\") or to the `Person` node indicating their motivation for traveling could improve narrative understanding.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Introduce Temporal and Causal Relationship Types:** Explicitly add relationship types that denote sequence (e.g., `precedes`, `follows`) and causality (e.g., `causes`, `results in`) between events.\n2.  **Develop Higher-Level Plot Node Types:** Consider introducing node types like `PlotPoint`, `IncitingIncident`, `Climax`, `Resolution` that can be linked to specific events or sequences of events.\n3.  **Refine and Consolidate Relationship Types:** Aggregate similar relationship types to reduce noise and focus on the most narratively significant connections.\n4.  **Enrich Entity Attributes:** Add attributes to entities that describe their role or significance within the story's plot (e.g., \"protagonist,\" \"antagonist,\" \"turning point location\").\n5.  **Structure for Narrative Arcs:** Design the graph to facilitate the identification of character arcs and thematic development, not just individual actions.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique that will be used to improve the graph construction prompt. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

The most common entity type is \"\" with 125 instances. The most frequent relationship type is \"involved in\" with 26 occurrences.\n\nThe critique on the graph was:\nThe current graph structure provides a rich but sometimes overwhelming amount of information. For the query \"What is the plot of the story?\", the primary area for improvement lies in **enhancing the narrative coherence and causal linking of events and character actions.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique:\n\n*   **Over-Generalization of Relationships:** While the sheer number of relationship types is impressive, many are too granular or lack clear semantic distinction for plot reconstruction. For example, the numerous variations of \"travels to,\" \"traveled to,\" \"travels towards,\" \"headed towards,\" etc., could be consolidated or given more specific types if they represent distinct narrative functions. Similarly, multiple \"attack\" variations might obscure the core conflict. The abundance of single-occurrence relationships (\"wants information about,\" \"motive for helping,\" \"protected\") also creates noise and makes it harder to identify the most critical plot drivers.\n\n*   **Lack of Explicit Event Sequencing:** The graph doesn't inherently capture the *order* or *causality* of events, which is crucial for plot. While events are present, there's no clear mechanism to link them chronologically or as cause-and-effect. For instance, \"Noork disguises himself\" followed by \"Noork fights guards\" needs explicit relational or attribute-based connections to show the progression.\n\n*   **Entity-Relationship Granularity Mismatch:** The graph is rich in specific entities (like individual \"Person\"s, \"Object\"s, and \"Weapon\"s) and their direct relationships. However, for a plot summary, a higher-level abstraction of \"plot points\" or \"story arcs\" is needed. The current graph focuses on individual interactions rather than the overarching narrative flow. For example, identifying a \"climax\" or \"resolution\" as distinct node types or through specific relationship patterns could significantly aid plot generation.\n\n*   **Contextual Depth for Key Entities:** While entities like \"Person\" and \"Location\" are abundant, their roles in the *plot* could be better defined. For example, instead of just `Person` - `traveled to` - `Location`, adding attributes to the `Location` node indicating its significance (e.g., \"key battleground,\" \"place of revelation\") or to the `Person` node indicating their motivation for traveling could improve narrative understanding.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Introduce Temporal and Causal Relationship Types:** Explicitly add relationship types that denote sequence (e.g., `precedes`, `follows`) and causality (e.g., `causes`, `results in`) between events.\n2.  **Develop Higher-Level Plot Node Types:** Consider introducing node types like `PlotPoint`, `IncitingIncident`, `Climax`, `Resolution` that can be linked to specific events or sequences of events.\n3.  **Refine and Consolidate Relationship Types:** Aggregate similar relationship types to reduce noise and focus on the most narratively significant connections.\n4.  **Enrich Entity Attributes:** Add attributes to entities that describe their role or significance within the story's plot (e.g., \"protagonist,\" \"antagonist,\" \"turning point location\").\n5.  **Structure for Narrative Arcs:** Design the graph to facilitate the identification of character arcs and thematic development, not just individual actions.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the chunk size can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

Crucial plot points, character developments, or causal relationships that span across the 500-word boundary could be split. This forces the graph extraction process to infer connections between separate chunks, increasing the likelihood of incomplete or disjointed subgraphs. For instance, if a character's motivation to act is explained in one chunk and their subsequent action occurs in the next, the LLM extracting the graph might miss the direct causal link if the chunk boundary falls between them.\n\n*   **Over-reliance on Cross-Chunk Inference:** When significant plot elements are split across chunks, the graph merging process becomes more critical and potentially error-prone. The system then relies heavily on the LLM's ability to infer connections between entities and events mentioned in different, non-contiguous chunks. This can lead to less precise relationships and a weaker overall narrative structure, contributing to the critique's point about \"Lack of Explicit Event Sequencing.\" The current graph exhibits many granular relationships, suggesting that many individual pieces of information were extracted, but their interconnections across larger narrative structures might be weakened by chunking.\n\n*   **Limited Context for Entity Roles:** A 500-word chunk may not always provide sufficient context to fully define the significance of an entity within the broader narrative. For example, a character's role as a protagonist or antagonist, or a location's importance as a \"turning point,\" might be established over a longer discourse. If this context is split across chunks, the graph extraction LLM might only capture a limited aspect of the entity, leading to the critique point about \"Contextual Depth for Key Entities.\"\n\n**Recommendation for Improvement:**\n\nConsider experimenting with larger chunk sizes (e.g., 750-1000 words) or adaptive chunking strategies.

The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the eye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of rock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for windows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at three distinct levels. Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple. Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another of their number. He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the jaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose rocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the central raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly worked metalâ€”gold, silver and brassâ€”vied with the faded garish colors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed two beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the wolf-headed shape a female.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The soft living of the temple, and the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch so well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his mouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful whether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the main temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his enemy. Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the sword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork leaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a moment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets. Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms. Hurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and slipped it around her slim shivering shoulders. \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely. \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know that this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile crossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told the girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared the guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\" Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched the soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your primary goal is to build a narrative-rich graph that captures the causal and sequential flow of events in a story, enabling rich plot-focused queries.\n\nWhen processing the provided text, follow these instructions:\n\n1.  **Identify and Represent Key Entities:**\n    *   Extract significant entities (e.g., characters, major objects, locations, organizations) that play a role in the narrative.\n    *   For each entity, provide a *concise description* focusing on their relevance to the plot. Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm, numbing it so he felt nothing for some time. One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with, Noork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. Noork At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Relationships are established to link Noork to his discarded watch, the boat, the rope, and his arrival in the cultivated field, as well as his use of the Misty Ones' robes for invisibility. The relationship between the cultivated field and the skull landmark is noted. Furthermore, Sarna's parentage and her status as a 'new slave' are captured, linking her and Tholon Dist to the event of her capture and the priests of Uzdon. The narrative flow is enhanced by defining events as first-class nodes and linking entities to them using 'involved in', 'initiates event', and 'occurs in' relationships.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two upper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty Ones climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to the slaves and common citizens of the island. As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two short swords rose to bar his way. \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere gruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the most beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the sacrifice is chosen.\" Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside. In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor sharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and shoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward impetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his left.

Existing entities like 'Slaves' and 'Common Citizens' have been enriched with descriptions clarifying their restriction from upper levels.

Your primary goal is to build a narrative-rich graph that captures the causal and sequential flow of events in a story, enabling rich plot-focused queries.\n\nWhen processing the provided text, follow these instructions:\n\n1.  **Identify and Represent Key Entities:**\n    *   Extract significant entities (e.g., characters, major objects, locations, organizations) that play a role in the narrative.\n    *   For each entity, provide a *concise description* focusing on their relevance to the plot. Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads vanished. These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it. Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from shoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy. For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake.

Your primary goal is to build a narrative-rich graph that captures the causal and sequential flow of events in a story, enabling rich plot-focused queries.\n\nWhen processing the provided text, follow these instructions:\n\n1.  **Identify and Represent Key Entities:**\n    *   Extract significant entities (e.g., characters, major objects, locations, organizations) that play a role in the narrative.\n    *   For each entity, provide a *concise description* focusing on their relevance to the plot. Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1945. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray volcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us. But of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by Luna's bulk, we know little. Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in diameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its meaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk, life that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval lake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the starry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth. In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called Noork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the trail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned girl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a sheathed dagger. Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine contours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the insignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration. Not forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged cliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest, and the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade,\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrichâ€”whose memory was gone completelyâ€”again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end. The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

analysis identified several new entities and relationships that expand the narrative's scope and detail. New locations like 'Sekk', 'Earth', 'Cosmic matter', and 'Moon' were identified, along with new concepts like 'Axis criminals' and 'Nazidom'. Key individuals and groups like the 'Vasads', the 'golden-skinned girl', and specific objects such as 'Doctor Karl Von Mark's crude space-ships' were also introduced. The relationships capture the movement and interactions between these entities, including travel ('traveled to', 'traveled from', 'traveled spaceward in'), location ('landed in', 'located in', 'located beyond'), actions ('searching for', 'restoring', 'trapped on', 'prefers gravity of'), and information exchange ('provided information to', 'gave name to'). The original graph had limited information about the specific locations and the context of Doctor Von Mark's actions and escape, which this update significantly enhances. For instance, the distinct roles of Sekk, the Moon, and the 'Cosmic matter' in the plot are now clearly defined, as are the Vasads' interactions with Noork. The narrative thread of Dietrich tracking Von Mark from Greece to Africa and then into space is also better represented with explicit relationships. Information about the origin and landing of the 'other bird' from 'space' is also new and crucial to the plot.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 2752, "user_prompt_length": 9544, "response_length": 16246, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 1703, "existing_graph_summary_length": 6544, "mode": "refinement"}}

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of the cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour the great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death of the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the words that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated them aloud. \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\" The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going back to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow and stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle giant. Noork grinned. \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her. \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you hunter or escaped slave?\" \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted narl last night when it attacked you.\" Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never far from the hilt of her hunting dagger. Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder of limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin. \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet you speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes opened yet wider. \"Who are you?\" \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the wild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for my friend.\" The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall and strong?

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the others. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two others, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering. The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies from the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the chamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the stone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl, was held prisoner. The steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water dotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two sputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and toward this Noork made his way. He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\" There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him. As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop aside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed. \"Gurn!\" cried Noork. A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother. And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed. Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain Dietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil man when my bird died.\" He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The evil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace with you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\" \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.

New characters like Tholon Sarna and Gurn were identified, along with their familial and friendly connections. The Vasads and Misty Ones emerged as important groups and concepts, with the Priests of Uzdon also playing a role in how the Misty Ones are perceived and handled. A significant plot point is Noork adopting the identity of Captain Dietrich, originating from America, which necessitated creating these as new entities and updating Noork's properties. Several key events were extracted to better represent the flow of the narrative, such as Noork's escape, Gurn's reveal, and the adoption of a new identity. Relationships were established to link these entities and events, focusing on causal and sequential connections like 'initiates event', 'leads to', 'causes', and 'involved in', as well as descriptive relationships like 'sister of', 'brother of', and 'from'. Existing entities like Von Mark were updated with new information about their status and interactions.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 2752, "user_prompt_length": 9317, "response_length": 19803, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 1476, "existing_graph_summary_length": 6544, "mode": "refinement"}}

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the shadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully. For a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction of the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then they jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to blood-slippery step. The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man with a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more. He sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a half-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps. In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging out, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle on the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion of the upper temple was muted to a murmur. So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that had dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to battle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm. He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two warriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous gurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes. Noork grinned. From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not snore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed to a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would not give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the room.\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

New relationships were created to capture the sequence of events, causal links, and interactions between entities. For example, the struggle on the 'shadowy stair' caused by the sword stabbing and leading to them rolling down, the sword clattering from the Misty One's clutch, Noork obtaining the sword and club, his entry into the 'torch-lighted doorway', and his actions to incapacitate the guards are all represented. The contrast between the noise level in the 'upper temple' and on the stairs was also noted. The relationships focus on 'causes', 'leads to', 'precedes', 'sequences of', 'involved in', 'dropped', 'obtained', 'approached', 'entered', 'prepared to battle', 'observed', 'lay on', 'filled', 'modified', 'rendered unable to give alarm', 'performed with', and 'initiates event' to build a narrative flow.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 2752, "user_prompt_length": 9543, "response_length": 18881, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 1702, "existing_graph_summary_length": 6544, "mode": "refinement"}}

Your goal is to construct a coherent narrative, specifically focusing on \"the plot of the story,\" by exploring a knowledge graph.\n\n**Your primary objective is to retrieve information that builds a sequential and causal understanding of the plot, not just a collection of facts.**\n\n**Key Directives:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Flow:** Always aim to connect retrieved information to build a story. When exploring nodes, consider how they advance the plot chronologically and causally. If you retrieve an event, look for its immediate consequences or preceding causes.\n2.  **Identify Plot-Driving Elements:** Focus on retrieving information directly related to the main protagonist's actions, conflicts, significant events, and their outcomes. Filter out tangential or background information that does not contribute to the core narrative arc.\n3.  **Leverage Relation Types for Narrative:** When using functions like `get_neighbors`, analyze the *types* of relationships (edges) and connected nodes. Prioritize relations that indicate:\n    *   **Temporal Sequence:** `precedes`, `follows`, `during`\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`\n    *   **Character Actions and Reactions:** `performs`, `is_acted_upon_by`, `reacts_to`\n    *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `fights`, `opposes`, `resolves`\n4.  **Targeted Exploration Strategy:**\n    *   Start with a clear query about the plot.\n    *   If a retrieved node represents an event, identify its direct antecedents and consequents. Use `get_neighbors` strategically to find these, specifying relation types where possible.\n    *   If a retrieved node represents a character, explore their key actions and interactions relevant to the main conflict.\n    *   Avoid indiscriminate exploration. Each retrieval step should have a clear purpose in building the narrative.\n5.  **Synthesize and Connect:** Your plan should demonstrate an understanding of how retrieved pieces fit together. Explicitly state why a particular retrieval step is important for understanding the plot.\n\n**Example of a good thought process:** \"The query asks for the plot. I've identified 'Noork fights guards' as a key event. To understand the plot progression, I need to know *why* he fought and *what happened next*. I will use `get_neighbors` focusing on relations like `causes` or `precedes` to find the inciting incident, and `results_in` or `follows` to find the outcome of the fight.\"\n\nYour output should be a sequence of tool calls and their justifications, demonstrating a clear strategy for uncovering the plot.", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 417 nodes and 549 relationships.

Your goal is to construct a coherent narrative, specifically focusing on \"the plot of the story,\" by exploring a knowledge graph.\n\n**Your primary objective is to retrieve information that builds a sequential and causal understanding of the plot, not just a collection of facts.**\n\n**Key Directives:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Flow:** Always aim to connect retrieved information to build a story. When exploring nodes, consider how they advance the plot chronologically and causally. If you retrieve an event, look for its immediate consequences or preceding causes.\n2.  **Identify Plot-Driving Elements:** Focus on retrieving information directly related to the main protagonist's actions, conflicts, significant events, and their outcomes. Filter out tangential or background information that does not contribute to the core narrative arc.\n3.  **Leverage Relation Types for Narrative:** When using functions like `get_neighbors`, analyze the *types* of relationships (edges) and connected nodes. Prioritize relations that indicate:\n    *   **Temporal Sequence:** `precedes`, `follows`, `during`\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`\n    *   **Character Actions and Reactions:** `performs`, `is_acted_upon_by`, `reacts_to`\n    *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `fights`, `opposes`, `resolves`\n4.  **Targeted Exploration Strategy:**\n    *   Start with a clear query about the plot.\n    *   If a retrieved node represents an event, identify its direct antecedents and consequents. Use `get_neighbors` strategically to find these, specifying relation types where possible.\n    *   If a retrieved node represents a character, explore their key actions and interactions relevant to the main conflict.\n    *   Avoid indiscriminate exploration. Each retrieval step should have a clear purpose in building the narrative.\n5.  **Synthesize and Connect:** Your plan should demonstrate an understanding of how retrieved pieces fit together. Explicitly state why a particular retrieval step is important for understanding the plot.\n\n**Example of a good thought process:** \"The query asks for the plot. I've identified 'Noork fights guards' as a key event. To understand the plot progression, I need to know *why* he fought and *what happened next*. I will use `get_neighbors` focusing on relations like `causes` or `precedes` to find the inciting incident, and `results_in` or `follows` to find the outcome of the fight.\"\n\nYour output should be a sequence of tool calls and their justifications, demonstrating a clear strategy for uncovering the plot.", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 417 nodes and 549 relationships.

They might be expecting a plot from a story they thought they provided or that the RAG system was supposed to find.\n*   **Unclear about the RAG system's function:** The response implies the RAG system's role was to *find* a plot from the \"provided information,\" which might not be the user's expectation. The user might have expected the RAG system to *generate* a plot or to access a different knowledge base.\n*   **Abrupt and unengaging:** The response is very dry and doesn't offer any further assistance or explanation.\n*   **Assumes user understanding:** It assumes the user understands what an \"empty graph with no nodes\" means in the context of a story plot.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to make the response more informative, helpful, and user-friendly, even when the RAG system cannot fulfill the request.\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, ranging from simple to more sophisticated:\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Level 1: Add Explanations and Context\n\nThis level focuses on explaining *why* the response is what it is and offering a slightly more helpful message.\n\n**Improved Response Example:**\n\n> \"I couldn't find any information about a story or its plot in the provided context. The data I was given appears to be an empty graph with no nodes, which doesn't contain any narrative details.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **\"I couldn't find any information...\"**: This phrasing is more user-friendly than directly stating \"The provided information describes...\". It shifts the focus to the system's inability to find the information.\n*   **\"...in the provided context.\"**: This clarifies that the limitation is with the information *given to the system*.\n*   **\"The data I was given appears to be...\"**: Softens the direct statement about the empty graph.\n*   **\"...which doesn't contain any narrative details.\"**: Connects the technical description (empty graph) to the user's query (plot of a story) by explaining its implication.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Level 2: Offer Next Steps and Clarify Capabilities\n\nThis level aims to guide the user on how to get a better result or understand what the system *can* do.\n\n**Improved Response Example:**\n\n> \"I'm sorry, but the information I have access to for this query appears to be an empty graph with no nodes. This means there's no story or plot details available to describe.\n>\n> To help me find the plot, could you please:\n>\n> *   **Provide the text of the story?**\n> *   **Specify the title and author of the story you're interested in?**\n>\n> Once I have more information, I'll do my best to tell you about the plot.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **\"I'm sorry, but...\"**: Adds politeness and empathy.\n*   **Clearly states the limitation:** Reaffirms the \"empty graph\" issue.\n*   **Offers concrete suggestions:** Guides the user on what to do next. This is crucial for a helpful AI.\n*   **Sets expectations:** \"Once I have more information, I'll do my best...\" reassures the user that the system is willing and capable, given the right input.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Level 3: More Sophisticated Handling of \"Empty Graph\"\n\nThis level assumes the RAG system might be misinterpreting a prompt that *should* have resulted in a plot, or that \"empty graph\" might be a placeholder for \"no relevant documents found.\"\n\n**Improved Response Example (Scenario: User expected a plot from a known story):**\n\n> \"I was unable to find any plot details for the story you requested. The current information available to me is like an empty canvas with no elements to draw from.\n>\n> To help me describe the plot, please try providing:\n>\n> *   **The full text of the story.**\n> *   **The exact title and author of the story you're looking for.**\n>\n> If you're trying to generate a story, please let me know what kind of plot you'd like me to create!\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **Metaphorical explanation:** \"empty canvas with no elements to draw from\" is a more relatable analogy than \"empty graph with no nodes.\"\n*   **Addresses potential user intent:** \"If you're trying to generate a story...\" anticipates another possible user goal.\n\n**Improved Response Example (Scenario: \"Empty graph\" is an internal error code or signifies no retrieval):**\n\n> \"I'm sorry, but I couldn't retrieve any relevant information to describe the plot of the story. It seems there's no content available for me to analyze at the moment.\n>\n> Please ensure you've provided the story text or its title and author correctly.

An LLM selects the hyperparameters (chunk size). The input text (where the information is located) is split into chunks based on the chosen chunk size. For each chunk, an LLM is used to extract a graph. The graphs are then merged.

The context obtained from the exploration is then passed to an LLM together with the query. The LLM generates an answer.\n\nHere is the current example with prompt, answer, and feedback:\nQuestion: What is the plot of the story?\nPrevious Answer Generation Prompt: You are a helpful and resourceful assistant designed to answer questions using information retrieved from a knowledge graph. Your primary goal is to provide accurate and comprehensive answers.\n\nWhen generating an answer, adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Completeness and Accuracy:**\n    *   Use the provided `Information` to construct the most complete and accurate answer possible.\n    *   Cite the source of information implicitly by drawing directly from the provided snippets.\n\n2.  **Synthesize and Infer:**\n    *   If the `Information` is fragmented or incomplete, *do not simply state that it is insufficient*.\n    *   **Attempt to synthesize the available fragments** into a coherent overview. Identify key entities, relationships, themes, or discernible events.\n    *   **Construct a partial answer** based on what *can* be inferred from the provided `Information`. Acknowledge the limitations of your answer while still providing value.\n\n3.  **Handle Insufficient Information Proactively:**\n    *   If the `Information` is fundamentally insufficient to answer the core of the user's question, clearly state the limitations.\n    *   **Specifically explain *what* crucial narrative elements or data points are missing** that prevent a complete answer.\n    *   **Suggest the *types* of additional information needed** to fully address the query. For example, if a plot is requested but missing, explain what plot elements (e.g., inciting incident, climax, character motivations) are absent.\n    *   **Offer to provide related details that *are* present** in the `Information`, even if they don't fully answer the original question.\n\n4.  **Maintain Clarity and Conciseness:**\n    *   Ensure your answers are easy to understand.\n    *   Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it if necessary.\n    *   Be direct and avoid unnecessary preamble.\n\n**Output Format:**\n*   Provide a direct answer based on the `Information`.\n*   If the `Information` is insufficient, follow the proactive guidance in point 3.\n\nRemember, your aim is to be as helpful as possible, even when faced with incomplete data, by synthesizing what is available and guiding the user on how to obtain a more complete answer.\nGenerated Answer: The provided information describes an empty graph with no nodes, which means there is no story or plot available to describe.\nResponse Feedback: ## Evaluation of the Response:\n\nThe response is **technically correct** given the input it received, but it is **unhelpful and lacks user-centricity**.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Accurate interpretation of the input:** It correctly identifies that the provided \"information\" (presumably the retrieved documents or context from the RAG system) contained an empty graph with no nodes.\n*   **Direct answer:** It directly addresses the query by stating that no story or plot is available.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of context for the user:** The user likely doesn't understand *why* the RAG system provided an empty graph. They might be expecting a plot from a story they thought they provided or that the RAG system was supposed to find.\n*   **Unclear about the RAG system's function:** The response implies the RAG system's role was to *find* a plot from the \"provided information,\" which might not be the user's expectation. The user might have expected the RAG system to *generate* a plot or to access a different knowledge base.\n*   **Abrupt and unengaging:** The response is very dry and doesn't offer any further assistance or explanation.\n*   **Assumes user understanding:** It assumes the user understands what an \"empty graph with no nodes\" means in the context of a story plot.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to make the response more informative, helpful, and user-friendly, even when the RAG system cannot fulfill the request.\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, ranging from simple to more sophisticated:\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Level 1: Add Explanations and Context\n\nThis level focuses on explaining *why* the response is what it is and offering a slightly more helpful message.\n\n**Improved Response Example:**\n\n> \"I couldn't find any information about a story or its plot in the provided context. The data I was given appears to be an empty graph with no nodes, which doesn't contain any narrative details.\"\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n*   **\"I couldn't find any information...\"**: This phrasing is more user-friendly than directly stating \"The provided information describes...\". It shifts the focus to the system's inability to find the information.\n*   **\"...in the provided context.\"**: This clarifies that the limitation is with the information *given to the system*.\n*   **\"The data I was given appears to be...\"**: Softens the direct statement about the empty graph.\n*   **\"...which doesn't contain any narrative details.\"**: Connects the technical description (empty graph) to the user's query (plot of a story) by explaining its implication.\n\n---\n\n### Improvement Level 2: Offer Next Steps and Clarify Capabilities\n\nThis level aims to guide the user on how to get a better result or understand what the system *can* do.\n\n**Improved Response Example:**\n\n> \"I'm sorry, but the information I have access to for this query appears to be an empty graph with no nodes.

Avoid overly technical jargon unless necessary and explained.\n3.  **Provide Actionable Next Steps:** Guide the user on what they can do to get a better result. This might involve providing more information, clarifying their request, or trying again.\n4.  **Clarify System Capabilities and Limitations:** Help the user understand what the RAG system can and cannot do.\n5.  **Use Analogies:** If a technical concept is the root of the issue (like an \"empty graph\"), use a relatable analogy.\n6.  **Offer Alternatives:** If the primary request cannot be met, suggest alternative ways the system *could* be helpful (e.g., generating a story if the user wanted to).\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system's response can transform from a technically accurate but unhelpful statement into a user-friendly interaction that guides the user towards a successful outcome.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the retrieved content can be improved.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

The core issue lies in the initial search strategy.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critical issues and recommendations:\n\n1.  **Ineffective Initial Search Strategy:** Moves 1-6 all propose searching for keywords like \"plot\" or \"story.\" While seemingly intuitive, this approach is too simplistic for graph exploration. The system assumes that explicit mentions of \"plot\" or \"story\" will lead to relevant nodes. However, the actual narrative elements are likely described through entities, actions, and relationships, not necessarily by nodes explicitly named \"plot.\"\n\n2.  **Lack of Understanding of Graph Structure:** The retrieval plan doesn't demonstrate an understanding of how information is typically represented in a knowledge graph derived from text. Instead of looking for narrative components, it searches for abstract concepts.\n\n3.  **No Iterative Refinement Based on Graph State:** Each move essentially repeats the same flawed strategy. There's no adaptation or learning from the fact that previous searches yielded nothing. The agent should recognize an empty graph and adjust its strategy, perhaps by trying a broader search or different node types.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Smarter Node Selection:** Instead of searching for abstract terms like \"plot,\" the initial move should focus on identifying the *main entities* or *events* within the text. This could be achieved by:\n    *   **Searching for specific entity types:** If the LLM can infer entity types (e.g., Person, Location, Event), it could search for nodes of these types.\n    *   **Broad keyword search for nouns/verbs:** A more general keyword search that identifies common nouns and action verbs might be more effective in finding starting points.\n    *   **Leveraging chunk metadata:** If chunks are processed sequentially, the system could try to find central nodes within the *first* chunk or across *multiple* initial chunks.\n\n2.  **Utilize Graph Exploration Functions More Effectively:** Once *any* node is retrieved (even if not directly related to \"plot\"), the agent should use functions like `get_neighbors` or `get_node_details` to expand its understanding. The current plan doesn't show any exploration beyond the initial, failed search.\n\n3.  **Implement a Fallback for Empty Graphs:** As noted in the previous critique, the system needs a mechanism to detect an empty graph *early* and either:\n    *   Attempt a different graph extraction/querying strategy.\n    *   Report the failure with more diagnostic information.\n    *   Fallback to a non-graph-based retrieval method if possible.\n\nIn summary, the retrieval plan needs to move beyond superficial keyword matching for abstract concepts and instead focus on identifying concrete elements within the graph structure to build context.

To begin, I need to find nodes that are directly related to the concept of a 'story'. Using a keyword search for 'story' seems like the most effective first step to identify relevant starting points in the graph.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nThe retrieval plan is fundamentally flawed because it consistently leads to an empty graph, rendering the entire RAG process ineffective. The core issue lies in the initial search strategy.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critical issues and recommendations:\n\n1.  **Ineffective Initial Search Strategy:** Moves 1-6 all propose searching for keywords like \"plot\" or \"story.\" While seemingly intuitive, this approach is too simplistic for graph exploration.

The most direct way to start understanding the plot is to search for nodes that are explicitly related to the concept of 'plot'.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nThe retrieval plan is fundamentally flawed because it consistently leads to an empty graph, rendering the entire RAG process ineffective. The core issue lies in the initial search strategy.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critical issues and recommendations:\n\n1.  **Ineffective Initial Search Strategy:** Moves 1-6 all propose searching for keywords like \"plot\" or \"story.\" While seemingly intuitive, this approach is too simplistic for graph exploration. The system assumes that explicit mentions of \"plot\" or \"story\" will lead to relevant nodes. However, the actual narrative elements are likely described through entities, actions, and relationships, not necessarily by nodes explicitly named \"plot.\"\n\n2.  **Lack of Understanding of Graph Structure:** The retrieval plan doesn't demonstrate an understanding of how information is typically represented in a knowledge graph derived from text. Instead of looking for narrative components, it searches for abstract concepts.\n\n3.  **No Iterative Refinement Based on Graph State:** Each move essentially repeats the same flawed strategy. There's no adaptation or learning from the fact that previous searches yielded nothing. The agent should recognize an empty graph and adjust its strategy, perhaps by trying a broader search or different node types.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Smarter Node Selection:** Instead of searching for abstract terms like \"plot,\" the initial move should focus on identifying the *main entities* or *events* within the text. This could be achieved by:\n    *   **Searching for specific entity types:** If the LLM can infer entity types (e.g., Person, Location, Event), it could search for nodes of these types.\n    *   **Broad keyword search for nouns/verbs:** A more general keyword search that identifies common nouns and action verbs might be more effective in finding starting points.\n    *   **Leveraging chunk metadata:** If chunks are processed sequentially, the system could try to find central nodes within the *first* chunk or across *multiple* initial chunks.\n\n2.  **Utilize Graph Exploration Functions More Effectively:** Once *any* node is retrieved (even if not directly related to \"plot\"), the agent should use functions like `get_neighbors` or `get_node_details` to expand its understanding. The current plan doesn't show any exploration beyond the initial, failed search.\n\n3.  **Implement a Fallback for Empty Graphs:** As noted in the previous critique, the system needs a mechanism to detect an empty graph *early* and either:\n    *   Attempt a different graph extraction/querying strategy.\n    *   Report the failure with more diagnostic information.\n    *   Fallback to a non-graph-based retrieval method if possible.\n\nIn summary, the retrieval plan needs to move beyond superficial keyword matching for abstract concepts and instead focus on identifying concrete elements within the graph structure to build context. The agent should also be more adaptive when encountering empty results.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the graph can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing. Focus on the most critical points and be concise.", "user_prompt": "Please provide your critique and feedback.", "llm_response": "The graph's structure and content present several areas for improvement to better support plot retrieval and understanding.\n\n**1. Lack of Central Narrative Nodes:** The most significant issue is the absence of nodes that directly represent or summarize the plot. While the graph contains numerous entities and relationships, there's no clear starting point or overarching structure that defines the story's progression. The retrieval plan's repeated failure to find \"plot\" or \"story\" nodes highlights this deficiency.\n\n**Recommendation:** Enhance the graph generation process to identify and explicitly represent key plot points. This could involve:\n    *   **Creating \"Plot\" or \"Story Arc\" Nodes:** A dedicated node type could act as an anchor, with relationships connecting it to major events, characters, and themes.\n    *   **Summarization Nodes:** For each significant segment of the text, generate a node that summarizes the events within that segment, linking it to the overarching plot node.\n\n**2. Over-reliance on Generic Relationship Types:** While the variety of relationships is extensive, many are too granular or specific to immediately convey plot progression. For instance, \"involved in,\" \"associated with,\" or \"located in\" are common but don't inherently describe narrative flow.\n\n**Recommendation:** Introduce more semantically rich relationship types that capture narrative causality and sequence. Consider relationships like:\n    *   `precedes_event`\n    *   `causes_outcome`\n    *   `resolves_conflict`\n    *   `introduces_character`\n    *   `develops_theme`\n\n**3. Imbalance in Entity Representation:** The overwhelming majority of nodes are of type \"\" (303 out of 417), with other crucial narrative elements like \"Event\" (36) and \"Person\" (10) being far less frequent. This suggests that the chunking or extraction process may be overly focused on generic entities rather than distinct narrative components.\n\n**Recommendation:** Refine the entity extraction process to better identify and categorize key narrative elements. This would involve:\n    *   **Improving Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Train or fine-tune NER models to more accurately identify and classify \"Event,\" \"Person,\" \"Location,\" and other relevant narrative entity types.\n    *   **Disambiguation and Linking:** Ensure that instances of the same entity are consistently linked to a single node, preventing fragmentation.\n\n**4. Suboptimal Graph Density and Connectivity:** A density of 0.0063 indicates a very sparse graph. While not inherently bad, combined with the lack of central narrative nodes, it makes it difficult to traverse the graph and uncover the story's structure.

The most common entity type is \"\" with 303 instances. The most frequent relationship type is \"involved in\" with 51 occurrences.\n\nThe critique on the graph was: \nThe graph's structure and content present several areas for improvement to better support plot retrieval and understanding.\n\n**1. Lack of Central Narrative Nodes:** The most significant issue is the absence of nodes that directly represent or summarize the plot. While the graph contains numerous entities and relationships, there's no clear starting point or overarching structure that defines the story's progression. The retrieval plan's repeated failure to find \"plot\" or \"story\" nodes highlights this deficiency.\n\n**Recommendation:** Enhance the graph generation process to identify and explicitly represent key plot points. This could involve:\n    *   **Creating \"Plot\" or \"Story Arc\" Nodes:** A dedicated node type could act as an anchor, with relationships connecting it to major events, characters, and themes.\n    *   **Summarization Nodes:** For each significant segment of the text, generate a node that summarizes the events within that segment, linking it to the overarching plot node.\n\n**2. Over-reliance on Generic Relationship Types:** While the variety of relationships is extensive, many are too granular or specific to immediately convey plot progression. For instance, \"involved in,\" \"associated with,\" or \"located in\" are common but don't inherently describe narrative flow.\n\n**Recommendation:** Introduce more semantically rich relationship types that capture narrative causality and sequence. Consider relationships like:\n    *   `precedes_event`\n    *   `causes_outcome`\n    *   `resolves_conflict`\n    *   `introduces_character`\n    *   `develops_theme`\n\n**3. Imbalance in Entity Representation:** The overwhelming majority of nodes are of type \"\" (303 out of 417), with other crucial narrative elements like \"Event\" (36) and \"Person\" (10) being far less frequent. This suggests that the chunking or extraction process may be overly focused on generic entities rather than distinct narrative components.\n\n**Recommendation:** Refine the entity extraction process to better identify and categorize key narrative elements. This would involve:\n    *   **Improving Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Train or fine-tune NER models to more accurately identify and classify \"Event,\" \"Person,\" \"Location,\" and other relevant narrative entity types.\n    *   **Disambiguation and Linking:** Ensure that instances of the same entity are consistently linked to a single node, preventing fragmentation.\n\n**4. Suboptimal Graph Density and Connectivity:** A density of 0.0063 indicates a very sparse graph. While not inherently bad, combined with the lack of central narrative nodes, it makes it difficult to traverse the graph and uncover the story's structure. The retrieval plan's failure to find any connected nodes for \"plot\" is a symptom of this sparsity in the context of narrative elements.\n\n**Recommendation:** Explore strategies to increase the graph's density *in relation to narrative flow*. This could involve:\n    *   **Cross-Chunk Relationship Inference:** When merging graphs from different chunks, actively look for and establish relationships that connect events or entities across chunk boundaries.\n    *   **Event Sequencing:** If events are identified, ensure they are linked sequentially or causally, even if the original text doesn't explicitly state \"event A caused event B.\"\n\nBy addressing these points, the graph can become a more effective tool for understanding and retrieving the plot of the story.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique that will be used to improve the graph construction prompt. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

The most common entity type is \"\" with 303 instances. The most frequent relationship type is \"involved in\" with 51 occurrences.\n\nThe critique on the graph was:\nThe graph's structure and content present several areas for improvement to better support plot retrieval and understanding.\n\n**1. Lack of Central Narrative Nodes:** The most significant issue is the absence of nodes that directly represent or summarize the plot. While the graph contains numerous entities and relationships, there's no clear starting point or overarching structure that defines the story's progression. The retrieval plan's repeated failure to find \"plot\" or \"story\" nodes highlights this deficiency.\n\n**Recommendation:** Enhance the graph generation process to identify and explicitly represent key plot points. This could involve:\n    *   **Creating \"Plot\" or \"Story Arc\" Nodes:** A dedicated node type could act as an anchor, with relationships connecting it to major events, characters, and themes.\n    *   **Summarization Nodes:** For each significant segment of the text, generate a node that summarizes the events within that segment, linking it to the overarching plot node.\n\n**2. Over-reliance on Generic Relationship Types:** While the variety of relationships is extensive, many are too granular or specific to immediately convey plot progression. For instance, \"involved in,\" \"associated with,\" or \"located in\" are common but don't inherently describe narrative flow.\n\n**Recommendation:** Introduce more semantically rich relationship types that capture narrative causality and sequence. Consider relationships like:\n    *   `precedes_event`\n    *   `causes_outcome`\n    *   `resolves_conflict`\n    *   `introduces_character`\n    *   `develops_theme`\n\n**3. Imbalance in Entity Representation:** The overwhelming majority of nodes are of type \"\" (303 out of 417), with other crucial narrative elements like \"Event\" (36) and \"Person\" (10) being far less frequent. This suggests that the chunking or extraction process may be overly focused on generic entities rather than distinct narrative components.\n\n**Recommendation:** Refine the entity extraction process to better identify and categorize key narrative elements. This would involve:\n    *   **Improving Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Train or fine-tune NER models to more accurately identify and classify \"Event,\" \"Person,\" \"Location,\" and other relevant narrative entity types.\n    *   **Disambiguation and Linking:** Ensure that instances of the same entity are consistently linked to a single node, preventing fragmentation.\n\n**4. Suboptimal Graph Density and Connectivity:** A density of 0.0063 indicates a very sparse graph. While not inherently bad, combined with the lack of central narrative nodes, it makes it difficult to traverse the graph and uncover the story's structure. The retrieval plan's failure to find any connected nodes for \"plot\" is a symptom of this sparsity in the context of narrative elements.\n\n**Recommendation:** Explore strategies to increase the graph's density *in relation to narrative flow*. This could involve:\n    *   **Cross-Chunk Relationship Inference:** When merging graphs from different chunks, actively look for and establish relationships that connect events or entities across chunk boundaries.\n    *   **Event Sequencing:** If events are identified, ensure they are linked sequentially or causally, even if the original text doesn't explicitly state \"event A caused event B.\"\n\nBy addressing these points, the graph can become a more effective tool for understanding and retrieving the plot of the story.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the chunk size can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

The critique highlights a lack of \"Central Narrative Nodes\" and the difficulty in finding \"plot\" or \"story\" nodes. This suggests that critical plot-driving events or thematic connections are being split across chunk boundaries. When a chunk is too small, an LLM generating a graph from it might only extract localized information, missing the broader context needed to identify overarching plot structures or synthesize relationships that span multiple chunks.\n\n2.  **Over-reliance on Generic Relationships and Entity Fragmentation:** The large number of generic relationship types like \"involved in\" and the imbalance in entity types (303 \"\"s vs. fewer \"Event\" or \"Person\" nodes) can be exacerbated by a chunk size that doesn't consistently capture meaningful interactions. If a 300-token chunk contains multiple vague mentions of an entity but not the specific actions or events they are involved in, the resulting graph might over-represent these generic entities and relationships. Conversely, if a critical plot event involves several entities and is split across two chunks, the relationships between those entities might be fragmented or weakened when the graphs are merged, leading to a less connected graph.\n\n3.  **Limited Causal Linkages Across Chunks:** While the critique recommends introducing more semantically rich relationships like `precedes_event` and `causes_outcome`, a fixed chunk size might hinder the LLM's ability to infer these across boundaries. If a cause-and-effect relationship spans two chunks, the LLM processing each chunk independently might not have enough information to establish a strong causal link during graph generation. This contributes to the graph's sparsity and the difficulty in tracing narrative consequences.\n\n**Recommendations for Chunk Size Improvement:**\n\n*   **Experiment with Larger Chunk Sizes:** Consider increasing the chunk size (e.g., to 500-750 tokens) to allow LLMs to process more contextual information within each chunk. This could improve the likelihood of capturing more complete events, character interactions, and thematic elements, potentially leading to more specific and narrative-rich nodes and relationships.\n*   **Adaptive Chunking or Overlapping Chunks:** Instead of a fixed size, explore adaptive chunking strategies that try to end chunks at natural narrative breaks (e.g., sentence boundaries, paragraph ends). Alternatively, using overlapping chunks can ensure that information at the boundaries of chunks is processed in multiple contexts, potentially strengthening cross-chunk relationships.\n*   **Prioritize Chunk Content:** Ensure that the chunking strategy prioritizes retaining key narrative elements (events, character introductions, conflicts) within individual chunks as much as possible, even if it means slightly varying chunk sizes.", "system_prompt_length": 14876, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 3290, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 14717, "enhanced_prompt_length": 14876, "response_length": 3290}}

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph. Your goal is to refine and enhance the existing graph by:\n1. Adding new entities and relationships that are mentioned in the text but missing from the graph\n2. Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 239 nodes and 254 relationships.

The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the eye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of rock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for windows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at three distinct levels. Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple. Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another of their number. He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the jaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose rocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the central raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly worked metalâ€”gold, silver and brassâ€”vied with the faded garish colors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed two beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the wolf-headed shape a female. These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura worshippedâ€”mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu! Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two upper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty Ones climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to the slaves and common citizens of the island. As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two short swords rose to bar his way. \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere gruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the most beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the sacrifice is chosen.\" Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside. In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor sharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and shoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward impetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his left. His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony structure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his hands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning gurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon it, and his shortened\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Properties for 'Noork' and 'Altar' were updated to include details derived from the text.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm, numbing it so he felt nothing for some time. One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with, Noork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. Noork At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes.\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white man's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so his robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed body. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the slightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon. The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple, and the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch so well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his mouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful whether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the main temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his enemy. Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the sword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork leaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a moment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets. Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms. Hurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and slipped it around her slim shivering shoulders. \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely. \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know that this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile crossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told the girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared the guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\" Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched the soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a good womanâ€”and ugly, my son.\" \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the Misty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island of Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions, are not unkind. \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will complete my checking of the gardens.\" Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field. \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised at what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden man's rather stupid face intently. \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1945. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray volcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us. But of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by Luna's bulk, we know little. Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in diameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its meaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk, life that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval lake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the starry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth. In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called Noork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the trail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned girl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a sheathed dagger. Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine contours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the insignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration. Not forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged cliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest, and the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had confirmed that belief. For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of the cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour the great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death of the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the words that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated them aloud. \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\" The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going back to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow and stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle giant. Noork grinned. \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her. \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you hunter or escaped slave?\" \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted narl last night when it attacked you.\" Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never far from the hilt of her hunting dagger. Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder of limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin. \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet you speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes opened yet wider. \"Who are you?\" \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the wild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for my friend.\" The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall and strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the shadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully. For a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction of the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then they jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to blood-slippery step. The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man with a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more. He sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a half-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps. In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging out, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle on the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion of the upper temple was muted to a murmur. So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that had dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to battle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm. He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two warriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous gurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes. Noork grinned. From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not snore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed to a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would not give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the room. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged into the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer here in the artificial light of the flickering torch. Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the others. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two others, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering. The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies from the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the chamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the stone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl, was held prisoner. The steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water dotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two sputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and toward this Noork made his way. He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\" There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna.

Key relationships have been established to show causality ('causes'), sequence ('precedes', 'consequence of'), involvement ('involved in', 'initiates event'), and interaction ('uses', 'carries', 'hides', 'calls', 'sees'). I also refined the descriptions for existing key entities like Noork, Tholon Sarna, and the Misty Ones to better reflect their roles in this specific narrative segment. The focus was on capturing the immediate actions and their direct consequences to build a coherent event chain. New entities and relationships were created only when they added distinct narrative information not present in the existing graph. For instance, the detailed steps of Noork's infiltration, incapacitation of guards, disguise, and approach to Sarna have been broken down into granular events and relationships. The existing entities 'Person_Guard_1' and 'Person_Guard_2' were referenced to link Noork's actions to specific, albeit unnamed, individuals.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 2752, "user_prompt_length": 10187, "response_length": 52331, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 3379, "existing_graph_summary_length": 5511, "mode": "refinement"}}

Your primary goal is to build a narrative-rich graph that captures the causal and sequential flow of events in a story, enabling rich plot-focused queries.\n\nWhen processing the provided text, follow these instructions:\n\n1.  **Identify and Represent Key Entities:**\n    *   Extract significant entities (e.g., characters, major objects, locations, organizations) that play a role in the narrative.\n    *   For each entity, provide a *concise description* focusing on their relevance to the plot. Avoid exhaustive property extraction unless it directly impacts narrative causality or progression.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Plot-Driving Relationships:**\n    *   Focus on extracting relationships that explain *how* and *why* events unfold.\n    *   **Crucially, identify and label relationships such as:**\n        *   `causes`: Indicates a direct causal link between events or actions.\n        *   `leads to`: Shows a consequence or result.\n        *   `initiates event`: Marks the start of a significant occurrence.\n        *   `conflicts with`: Describes opposition or struggle between entities or events.\n        *   `sequences of`: Denotes events occurring in a specific order.\n        *   `precedes`: Explicitly states one event happens before another.\n        *   `consequence of`: Explicitly states one event is the result of another.\n        *   `involved in`: Links entities to events.\n    *   For each relationship, provide *brief, specific evidence* from the text that supports the connection.\n\n3.  **Represent Events as First-Class Nodes:**\n    *   Treat significant narrative events as distinct `Event` nodes.\n    *   Link `Event` nodes to the `Entity` nodes involved in them.\n    *   Connect `Event` nodes to each other using plot-driving temporal and causal relationships (e.g., `precedes`, `consequence of`, `causes`).\n\n4.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:**\n    *   Construct the graph with a narrative-centric approach. The sequence and causality of events should be the primary organizing principle, with entities described in relation to these events.\n    *   Avoid an entity-centric bias; the plot's progression is paramount.\n\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   Output the graph in JSON format, with distinct lists for `entities`, `events`, and `relationships`.\n    *   Ensure each node and relationship has a unique `id`.\n    *   Relationships should clearly reference the `source` and `target` node IDs and have a descriptive `label` (from the prioritized list above) and concise `evidence`.\n\nBy focusing on events and their causal/sequential connections, you will create a graph that accurately represents the narrative's progression, making it ideal for plot-driven analysis.", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrichâ€”whose memory was gone completelyâ€”again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end. The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

For example, the pursuit between Stephen Dietrich and Doctor Karl Von Mark is now explicitly linked, as is Doctor Karl Von Mark's work on Nazidom and his preference for Sekk's gravity. Noork's journey and interactions, such as using a dugout canoe, encountering a wall, and wearing Misty One robes, have also been detailed through new relationships.

These represent concrete narrative elements and their interactions.\n\n**Answering User Queries (e.g., \"What is the plot of the story?\"):**\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Structure:** Plots are formed by sequences of events and character actions, not by abstract keywords like \"plot\" or \"story.\" Your retrieval strategy should focus on identifying and connecting these concrete narrative components.\n\n2.  **Start with Concrete Elements:**\n    *   If the query asks for a narrative summary (e.g., plot), begin by searching for `Event` nodes or by broadly searching for common narrative nouns or verbs related to the query's subject matter.\n    *   Avoid searching for abstract terms like \"plot,\" \"story,\" or \"summary\" directly as keywords in `search_nodes_by_keyword`. These are unlikely to yield relevant starting points.\n\n3.  **Utilize Graph Exploration Tools:**\n    *   **`search_nodes_by_types(node_type='Event')`**: Use this to find core events in the narrative.\n    *   **`get_neighbors(node_id)`**: Expand from retrieved nodes to discover connected entities and events, building context.\n    *   **`search_relations_by_type(relation_type=...)`**: Explore causal links, conflicts, and involvements between entities using specific relationship types (e.g., `initiates event`, `causes`, `conflicts with`, `involved in`).\n\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:**\n    *   If an initial retrieval attempt yields no or insufficient results, do *not* repeat the same failed strategy.\n    *   Adapt your approach: try a different node type, a different search function, or broaden/narrow your search terms based on the context.\n    *   Document your plan step-by-step, clearly stating the function called, its arguments, and the rationale.\n\n**Example Strategy for \"What is the plot of the story?\":**\n*   **Step 1:** `search_nodes_by_types(node_type='Event')` to get a starting set of narrative events.\n*   **Step 2:** `get_neighbors(node_id=<first_event_id>)` to explore events or characters connected to the first event.\n*   **Step 3:** `search_relations_by_type(relation_type='causes', node_id=<related_event_id>)` to find causal links and build a sequence.\n*   **Step 4:** Continue expanding using `get_neighbors` and `search_relations_by_type` to trace the story's progression, focusing on `Event`, `Person`, and connecting relationships.\n\nAlways aim for a diverse and structured approach that traverses the graph's relationships to construct a comprehensive answer.", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 561 nodes and 571 relationships.

Your goal is to formulate effective retrieval plans that leverage the graph's structure and available tools.\n\n**Understanding the Graph:**\nThe knowledge graph contains various node types including `Event`, `Location`, and `Person`, and relationship types such as `involved in`, `initiates event`, `causes`, `conflicts with`, and `traveled to`. These represent concrete narrative elements and their interactions.\n\n**Answering User Queries (e.g., \"What is the plot of the story?\"):**\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Structure:** Plots are formed by sequences of events and character actions, not by abstract keywords like \"plot\" or \"story.\" Your retrieval strategy should focus on identifying and connecting these concrete narrative components.\n\n2.  **Start with Concrete Elements:**\n    *   If the query asks for a narrative summary (e.g., plot), begin by searching for `Event` nodes or by broadly searching for common narrative nouns or verbs related to the query's subject matter.\n    *   Avoid searching for abstract terms like \"plot,\" \"story,\" or \"summary\" directly as keywords in `search_nodes_by_keyword`. These are unlikely to yield relevant starting points.\n\n3.  **Utilize Graph Exploration Tools:**\n    *   **`search_nodes_by_types(node_type='Event')`**: Use this to find core events in the narrative.\n    *   **`get_neighbors(node_id)`**: Expand from retrieved nodes to discover connected entities and events, building context.\n    *   **`search_relations_by_type(relation_type=...)`**: Explore causal links, conflicts, and involvements between entities using specific relationship types (e.g., `initiates event`, `causes`, `conflicts with`, `involved in`).\n\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:**\n    *   If an initial retrieval attempt yields no or insufficient results, do *not* repeat the same failed strategy.\n    *   Adapt your approach: try a different node type, a different search function, or broaden/narrow your search terms based on the context.\n    *   Document your plan step-by-step, clearly stating the function called, its arguments, and the rationale.\n\n**Example Strategy for \"What is the plot of the story?\":**\n*   **Step 1:** `search_nodes_by_types(node_type='Event')` to get a starting set of narrative events.\n*   **Step 2:** `get_neighbors(node_id=<first_event_id>)` to explore events or characters connected to the first event.\n*   **Step 3:** `search_relations_by_type(relation_type='causes', node_id=<related_event_id>)` to find causal links and build a sequence.\n*   **Step 4:** Continue expanding using `get_neighbors` and `search_relations_by_type` to trace the story's progression, focusing on `Event`, `Person`, and connecting relationships.\n\nAlways aim for a diverse and structured approach that traverses the graph's relationships to construct a comprehensive answer.", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 561 nodes and 571 relationships.

Your goal is to formulate effective retrieval plans that leverage the graph's structure and available tools.\n\n**Understanding the Graph:**\nThe knowledge graph contains various node types including `Event`, `Location`, and `Person`, and relationship types such as `involved in`, `initiates event`, `causes`, `conflicts with`, and `traveled to`. These represent concrete narrative elements and their interactions.\n\n**Answering User Queries (e.g., \"What is the plot of the story?\"):**\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Structure:** Plots are formed by sequences of events and character actions, not by abstract keywords like \"plot\" or \"story.\" Your retrieval strategy should focus on identifying and connecting these concrete narrative components.\n\n2.  **Start with Concrete Elements:**\n    *   If the query asks for a narrative summary (e.g., plot), begin by searching for `Event` nodes or by broadly searching for common narrative nouns or verbs related to the query's subject matter.\n    *   Avoid searching for abstract terms like \"plot,\" \"story,\" or \"summary\" directly as keywords in `search_nodes_by_keyword`. These are unlikely to yield relevant starting points.\n\n3.  **Utilize Graph Exploration Tools:**\n    *   **`search_nodes_by_types(node_type='Event')`**: Use this to find core events in the narrative.\n    *   **`get_neighbors(node_id)`**: Expand from retrieved nodes to discover connected entities and events, building context.\n    *   **`search_relations_by_type(relation_type=...)`**: Explore causal links, conflicts, and involvements between entities using specific relationship types (e.g., `initiates event`, `causes`, `conflicts with`, `involved in`).\n\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:**\n    *   If an initial retrieval attempt yields no or insufficient results, do *not* repeat the same failed strategy.\n    *   Adapt your approach: try a different node type, a different search function, or broaden/narrow your search terms based on the context.\n    *   Document your plan step-by-step, clearly stating the function called, its arguments, and the rationale.\n\n**Example Strategy for \"What is the plot of the story?\":**\n*   **Step 1:** `search_nodes_by_types(node_type='Event')` to get a starting set of narrative events.\n*   **Step 2:** `get_neighbors(node_id=<first_event_id>)` to explore events or characters connected to the first event.\n*   **Step 3:** `search_relations_by_type(relation_type='causes', node_id=<related_event_id>)` to find causal links and build a sequence.\n*   **Step 4:** Continue expanding using `get_neighbors` and `search_relations_by_type` to trace the story's progression, focusing on `Event`, `Person`, and connecting relationships.\n\nAlways aim for a diverse and structured approach that traverses the graph's relationships to construct a comprehensive answer.", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 561 nodes and 571 relationships.

A plot typically outlines a sequence of events, including the main conflict, rising action, climax, and resolution.\n>\n> To help me describe the plot, could you please provide a more detailed narrative summary, or the full text of the story?\n>\n> Alternatively, I can help you by:\n> *   Summarizing the individual events mentioned.\n> *   Identifying the key characters and their apparent roles.\n> *   Extracting specific details you might be looking for from the text you sent.\"\n\n**Scenario 2: User did NOT provide text.**\n\n> \"I can help you understand the plot of a story, but I need the story's text or a detailed summary first. The information I have received so far doesn't contain the story itself.\n>\n> Please provide the text of the story, or a description that includes:\n> *   The main characters and their goals.\n> *   The central conflict or problem they face.\n> *   The sequence of key events that lead to the story's conclusion.\n> *   How the conflict is resolved.\n>\n> Once you provide this information, I'll do my best to outline the plot for you.\"\n\n**Key Takeaway for Improvement:**\n\nWhen a RAG system cannot fulfill a direct request, its response should pivot from a simple \"no\" to a helpful explanation and guidance on how to achieve the user's goal.
