Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others.

Concepts like 'Misty Ones' and objects like 'two short swords' were also identified. Relationships were inferred from verbs and prepositions, for example, 'Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!' establishes a 'mate' relationship. 'Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp' indicates Noork 'walked down' the 'central ramp'. The text also specifies restrictions, such as 'upper levels, then, were forbidden to the slaves and common citizens', establishing a 'forbidden to' relationship.

Focus on the most critical points and be concise.", "user_prompt": "Please provide your critique and feedback.", "llm_response": "The retrieved context is insufficient to answer the query about the story's plot. While it successfully identifies numerous characters and some initial relationships, it fails to extract any narrative progression or plot points.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the issues and suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Critique of Retrieved Content:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Extraction:** The primary issue is that the LLM agent, when exploring the graph, did not prioritize or successfully extract information pertaining to events, conflicts, resolutions, or the sequence of actions that constitute a plot. The focus seems to have remained on entity identification and direct relationships.\n2.  **Overly Broad Initial Node List (Iteration 1):** The first iteration listed a vast number of nodes, many of which were generic (e.g., \"girl,\" \"guard,\" \"priests\") or appeared to be variations of the same entity (e.g., \"Captain Dietrich,\" \"Dietrich,\" \"Stephen Dietrich\"). This broadness might have diluted the focus for subsequent graph exploration.\n3.  **Limited Relationship Depth (Iteration 2):** While Iteration 2 shows more specific relationships (e.g., \"from,\" \"Addressed,\" \"interacts with\"), these are still largely focused on character-to-character connections and origins, not on plot-driving events. For example, \"Doctor Von Mark addressed Captain Dietrich\" is a character interaction, but the *reason* for the address or the *outcome* of it is missing, which would be crucial for plot understanding.\n4.  **Focus on Character Attributes over Actions:** The extracted information describes *who* characters are or *how* they are related, but not *what they do* in a narrative sense. The plot is driven by actions and consequences, which are absent.\n5.  **Incomplete Graph Exploration (Implied):** The system states, \"The connections of Node X have not been explored yet\" for many nodes. This suggests that the exploration strategy was either incomplete or did not prioritize exploring nodes that might lead to plot-related information.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Refine Graph Exploration Strategy:**\n    *   **Event-Centric Exploration:** The LLM agent's exploration functions should be guided to look for nodes or relation types that signify actions, events, causality, or narrative progression (e.g., \"happened before,\" \"caused by,\" \"leads to,\" \"confronted,\" \"decided to\").\n    *   **Prioritize Core Characters:** After identifying key entities, the system should prioritize exploring connections of central characters for plot-driving interactions rather than exhaustively listing every possible node.\n2.  **Enhance Graph Extraction LLM:**\n    *   **Prompting for Narrative Elements:** The LLM responsible for graph extraction from chunks should be prompted to identify not just entities and relationships, but also significant actions, dialogue that moves the plot, and motivations. For example, instead of just \"Captain Dietrich -> interacts with -> Gurn,\" it could extract \"Captain Dietrich -> says to Gurn -> 'No longer am I a man without a name'\" and potentially infer the narrative significance of this statement.\n    *   **Temporal Information:** If possible, the extraction should attempt to capture the temporal order of events or dialogues.\n3.  **Improve Graph Merging and Querying:**\n    *   **Consolidate Similar Nodes:** Implement better heuristics or LLM capabilities to merge synonymous or closely related entities (e.g., \"Captain Dietrich,\" \"Dietrich,\" \"Stephen Dietrich\") more effectively before exploration.\n    *   **Query for Plot Keywords:** The LLM agent's functions should allow querying for entities or relations that are commonly associated with plot, such as verbs of action, conflict, or decision-making.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** If the initial exploration yields only character lists, the system should have a mechanism to re-evaluate the graph and explore different paths, specifically looking for narrative elements based on the query (\"What is the plot?\"). This might involve identifying \"story\" or \"plot\" as a meta-entity or concept that needs to be linked.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the system would be better equipped to extract and present the narrative flow of a story, rather than just its character roster.", "system_prompt_length": 10946, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 4258, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 10787, "enhanced_prompt_length": 10946, "response_length": 4258}}

While it successfully identifies numerous characters and some initial relationships, it fails to extract any narrative progression or plot points.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the issues and suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Critique of Retrieved Content:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Extraction:** The primary issue is that the LLM agent, when exploring the graph, did not prioritize or successfully extract information pertaining to events, conflicts, resolutions, or the sequence of actions that constitute a plot. The focus seems to have remained on entity identification and direct relationships.\n2.  **Overly Broad Initial Node List (Iteration 1):** The first iteration listed a vast number of nodes, many of which were generic (e.g., \"girl,\" \"guard,\" \"priests\") or appeared to be variations of the same entity (e.g., \"Captain Dietrich,\" \"Dietrich,\" \"Stephen Dietrich\"). This broadness might have diluted the focus for subsequent graph exploration.\n3.  **Limited Relationship Depth (Iteration 2):** While Iteration 2 shows more specific relationships (e.g., \"from,\" \"Addressed,\" \"interacts with\"), these are still largely focused on character-to-character connections and origins, not on plot-driving events. For example, \"Doctor Von Mark addressed Captain Dietrich\" is a character interaction, but the *reason* for the address or the *outcome* of it is missing, which would be crucial for plot understanding.\n4.  **Focus on Character Attributes over Actions:** The extracted information describes *who* characters are or *how* they are related, but not *what they do* in a narrative sense. The plot is driven by actions and consequences, which are absent.\n5.  **Incomplete Graph Exploration (Implied):** The system states, \"The connections of Node X have not been explored yet\" for many nodes. This suggests that the exploration strategy was either incomplete or did not prioritize exploring nodes that might lead to plot-related information.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Refine Graph Exploration Strategy:**\n    *   **Event-Centric Exploration:** The LLM agent's exploration functions should be guided to look for nodes or relation types that signify actions, events, causality, or narrative progression (e.g., \"happened before,\" \"caused by,\" \"leads to,\" \"confronted,\" \"decided to\").\n    *   **Prioritize Core Characters:** After identifying key entities, the system should prioritize exploring connections of central characters for plot-driving interactions rather than exhaustively listing every possible node.\n2.  **Enhance Graph Extraction LLM:**\n    *   **Prompting for Narrative Elements:** The LLM responsible for graph extraction from chunks should be prompted to identify not just entities and relationships, but also significant actions, dialogue that moves the plot, and motivations. For example, instead of just \"Captain Dietrich -> interacts with -> Gurn,\" it could extract \"Captain Dietrich -> says to Gurn -> 'No longer am I a man without a name'\" and potentially infer the narrative significance of this statement.\n    *   **Temporal Information:** If possible, the extraction should attempt to capture the temporal order of events or dialogues.\n3.  **Improve Graph Merging and Querying:**\n    *   **Consolidate Similar Nodes:** Implement better heuristics or LLM capabilities to merge synonymous or closely related entities (e.g., \"Captain Dietrich,\" \"Dietrich,\" \"Stephen Dietrich\") more effectively before exploration.\n    *   **Query for Plot Keywords:** The LLM agent's functions should allow querying for entities or relations that are commonly associated with plot, such as verbs of action, conflict, or decision-making.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** If the initial exploration yields only character lists, the system should have a mechanism to re-evaluate the graph and explore different paths, specifically looking for narrative elements based on the query (\"What is the plot?\"). This might involve identifying \"story\" or \"plot\" as a meta-entity or concept that needs to be linked.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the system would be better equipped to extract and present the narrative flow of a story, rather than just its character roster.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the retrieval plan can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing. Focus on the most critical points and be concise.", "user_prompt": "Please provide your critique and feedback.", "llm_response": "The retrieval plan needs significant improvement, particularly in its ability to extract narrative content for answering a plot-related query.\n\n**Critique of the Current Retrieval Plan:**\n\n1.  **Overemphasis on Entity Identification:**\n    *   **Iteration 1:** The initial step over-generates a very broad list of nodes, including many generic or redundant entries (e.g., \"guard,\" \"the girl,\" variations of \"Dietrich\"). This dilutes the focus and makes it harder to pinpoint key narrative elements.\n    *   **Iteration 2:** While it moves to exploring specific character connections, it remains focused on *who* is connected to *whom* and *how* (e.g., \"Addressed,\" \"interacts with,\" \"has feelings for\"). This is a character-centric view, not a plot-centric one.\n\n2.  **Lack of Narrative Progression Extraction:**\n    *   The core issue is that the system is not designed to identify or extract plot points. The query asks for \"the plot,\" which requires understanding sequences of events, conflicts, motivations, and resolutions. The current graph exploration focuses on static relationships rather than dynamic actions.\n    *   Even when relationships are described (e.g., \"Doctor Von Mark addressed Captain Dietrich\"), the *purpose* or *outcome* of the interaction â€“ crucial plot drivers â€“ are not captured or prioritized.\n\n3.  **Ineffective Exploration Strategy for Plot:**\n    *   The plan correctly identifies that exploring connections is necessary, but the *type* of connections explored is not aligned with understanding a plot. For instance, exploring \"neighbors\" or \"relationships\" is insufficient without also looking for nodes or edges representing *actions*, *events*, *causes*, or *consequences*.\n    *   Iteration 3 returning an empty graph after searching for \"plot\" suggests a failure in either graph construction (the plot information wasn't represented) or the search strategy (it didn't know *how* to find plot information within the graph structure).\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Refine Initial Node Selection:** Instead of a broad scan, prompt the LLM to identify potential *protagonists*, *antagonists*, and *key locations* based on the initial text, aligning with plot structure.\n2.  **Develop Plot-Oriented Graph Exploration Functions:**\n    *   Introduce functions to explore *actions* and *events* associated with entities.\n    *   Prioritize exploring relationships that indicate causality (\"causes,\" \"leads to\"), temporal sequence (\"happened before,\" \"followed by\"), or conflict (\"confronts,\" \"opposes\").\n    *   When exploring, actively look for verbs and action-oriented descriptions in relation text.\n3.  **Enhance Graph Extraction LLM:** Prompt the LLM to extract not just entities and relationships, but also key plot-driving *events*, *dialogue snippets that reveal motivation or advance the story*, and *outcomes of interactions*.\n4.  **Targeted \"Plot\" Search:** If the query is specifically about the plot, the system should try to identify nodes or edges tagged with narrative concepts (e.g., \"inciting incident,\" \"climax,\" \"resolution\") or look for sequences of actions performed by main characters. Merging and consolidating entities (e.g., all \"Dietrich\" variants) should be a higher priority.", "system_prompt_length": 14871, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 3245, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 14712, "enhanced_prompt_length": 14871, "response_length": 3245}}

While a diverse set of connections can be useful, the graph appears to be a dense collection of factual assertions rather than a structured representation of a plot. For instance, many relationships like \"is a,\" \"citizen of,\" \"associated with,\" and \"interacts with\" are too general to convey plot progression.\n2.  **Lack of Temporal and Causal Information:** A plot is inherently sequential and driven by cause-and-effect. The graph lacks explicit mechanisms to represent temporal order (e.g., \"happened before,\" \"followed by\") or causal links (\"causes,\" \"leads to\"). While some relationships like \"leads to\" exist, they are few and not prioritized. Without this, reconstructing a narrative sequence is extremely difficult.\n3.  **Undifferentiated Narrative Elements:** Key plot drivers such as conflicts, goals, motivations, and resolutions are not clearly identifiable as distinct node or relationship types. The graph doesn't distinguish between a character's mere presence in a location and a pivotal event that occurs there. For example, \"attacked\" and \"attacks\" relationships are present, but the context, stakes, and outcomes of these attacks are not explicitly modeled in a way that facilitates plot understanding.\n4.  **Entity Resolution Issues:** The existence of similar relationships like \"associated with\" and \"associatedwith\" (3 instances each) suggests potential inconsistencies in entity/relationship extraction. This fragmentation makes it harder to consolidate information about specific plot points or characters.\n\n**Critique of the Retrieval Plan:**\n\n1.  **Inadequate for Plot Extraction:** The retrieval plan's initial step of identifying all \"Person\" nodes is a reasonable starting point for character identification, but it's insufficient for understanding the plot. It prioritizes *who* over *what happened* and *why*.\n2.  **Focus on Static Relationships:** The plan seems geared towards understanding character relationships and interactions rather than the progression of events. Identifying that \"Person A interacts with Person B\" is not the same as understanding the *narrative significance* of that interaction.\n3.  **Failure to Identify Narrative Structure:** The plan doesn't attempt to find nodes or relationships that explicitly represent story elements like conflicts, challenges, goals, or resolutions. The agent needs to be guided to look for verbs that indicate actions and events critical to the plot.\n4.  **Ineffective Search for \"Plot\":** The retrieval plan's attempt to search for \"plot\" directly, resulting in an empty graph, indicates a fundamental mismatch between the query's intent and the graph's structure.

The most frequent relationship type is \"inhabits\" with 5 occurrences.\n\nThe critique on the graph was: \nThe graph and retrieval plan for understanding the \"plot of the story\" query highlight significant limitations in the current GraphRAG system's ability to extract narrative information.\n\n**Critique of the Graph:**\n\n1.  **Over-reliance on Generic Relationships:** The sheer volume of relationship types, many with low frequencies (e.g., 58 unique relationship types, with many appearing only once or twice), suggests a lack of structured narrative representation. While a diverse set of connections can be useful, the graph appears to be a dense collection of factual assertions rather than a structured representation of a plot. For instance, many relationships like \"is a,\" \"citizen of,\" \"associated with,\" and \"interacts with\" are too general to convey plot progression.\n2.  **Lack of Temporal and Causal Information:** A plot is inherently sequential and driven by cause-and-effect. The graph lacks explicit mechanisms to represent temporal order (e.g., \"happened before,\" \"followed by\") or causal links (\"causes,\" \"leads to\"). While some relationships like \"leads to\" exist, they are few and not prioritized. Without this, reconstructing a narrative sequence is extremely difficult.\n3.  **Undifferentiated Narrative Elements:** Key plot drivers such as conflicts, goals, motivations, and resolutions are not clearly identifiable as distinct node or relationship types. The graph doesn't distinguish between a character's mere presence in a location and a pivotal event that occurs there. For example, \"attacked\" and \"attacks\" relationships are present, but the context, stakes, and outcomes of these attacks are not explicitly modeled in a way that facilitates plot understanding.\n4.  **Entity Resolution Issues:** The existence of similar relationships like \"associated with\" and \"associatedwith\" (3 instances each) suggests potential inconsistencies in entity/relationship extraction. This fragmentation makes it harder to consolidate information about specific plot points or characters.\n\n**Critique of the Retrieval Plan:**\n\n1.  **Inadequate for Plot Extraction:** The retrieval plan's initial step of identifying all \"Person\" nodes is a reasonable starting point for character identification, but it's insufficient for understanding the plot. It prioritizes *who* over *what happened* and *why*.\n2.  **Focus on Static Relationships:** The plan seems geared towards understanding character relationships and interactions rather than the progression of events. Identifying that \"Person A interacts with Person B\" is not the same as understanding the *narrative significance* of that interaction.\n3.  **Failure to Identify Narrative Structure:** The plan doesn't attempt to find nodes or relationships that explicitly represent story elements like conflicts, challenges, goals, or resolutions. The agent needs to be guided to look for verbs that indicate actions and events critical to the plot.\n4.  **Ineffective Search for \"Plot\":** The retrieval plan's attempt to search for \"plot\" directly, resulting in an empty graph, indicates a fundamental mismatch between the query's intent and the graph's structure. The graph doesn't appear to have nodes or tags explicitly labeled \"plot.\"\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Enhance Graph Schema:**\n    *   **Introduce Event Nodes:** Create distinct \"Event\" nodes that can be linked to characters, locations, and objects. These events should have properties like time, cause, and outcome.\n    *   **Develop Narrative Relationship Types:** Incorporate relationships that explicitly convey plot progression, such as `causes_event`, `leads_to_conflict`, `achieves_goal`, `reveals_motivation`, `resolves_conflict`, `precedes`, `follows`.\n    *   **Character Archetypes and Roles:** Distinguish between protagonist, antagonist, supporting characters, etc., to better structure the narrative focus.\n\n2.  **Improve Graph Extraction:**\n    *   Prompt the LLM to identify and extract key plot points, turning points, conflicts, and resolutions from the text, not just entities and static relationships.\n    *   Prioritize extracting action verbs and their direct objects/subjects to build a more dynamic graph.\n\n3.  **Refine Retrieval Strategies:**\n    *   **Event-Centric Exploration:** After identifying key characters, the retrieval plan should prioritize exploring \"Event\" nodes associated with them.\n    *   **Causal and Temporal Pathfinding:** Develop strategies to traverse paths of events using causal and temporal relationships to reconstruct the narrative sequence.\n    *   **Identify Conflict and Resolution:** Specifically look for relationships indicating conflict, opposition, and their subsequent resolutions.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique that will be used to improve the graph construction prompt. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

The most frequent relationship type is \"inhabits\" with 5 occurrences.\n\nThe critique on the graph was:\nThe graph and retrieval plan for understanding the \"plot of the story\" query highlight significant limitations in the current GraphRAG system's ability to extract narrative information.\n\n**Critique of the Graph:**\n\n1.  **Over-reliance on Generic Relationships:** The sheer volume of relationship types, many with low frequencies (e.g., 58 unique relationship types, with many appearing only once or twice), suggests a lack of structured narrative representation. While a diverse set of connections can be useful, the graph appears to be a dense collection of factual assertions rather than a structured representation of a plot. For instance, many relationships like \"is a,\" \"citizen of,\" \"associated with,\" and \"interacts with\" are too general to convey plot progression.\n2.  **Lack of Temporal and Causal Information:** A plot is inherently sequential and driven by cause-and-effect. The graph lacks explicit mechanisms to represent temporal order (e.g., \"happened before,\" \"followed by\") or causal links (\"causes,\" \"leads to\"). While some relationships like \"leads to\" exist, they are few and not prioritized. Without this, reconstructing a narrative sequence is extremely difficult.\n3.  **Undifferentiated Narrative Elements:** Key plot drivers such as conflicts, goals, motivations, and resolutions are not clearly identifiable as distinct node or relationship types. The graph doesn't distinguish between a character's mere presence in a location and a pivotal event that occurs there. For example, \"attacked\" and \"attacks\" relationships are present, but the context, stakes, and outcomes of these attacks are not explicitly modeled in a way that facilitates plot understanding.\n4.  **Entity Resolution Issues:** The existence of similar relationships like \"associated with\" and \"associatedwith\" (3 instances each) suggests potential inconsistencies in entity/relationship extraction. This fragmentation makes it harder to consolidate information about specific plot points or characters.\n\n**Critique of the Retrieval Plan:**\n\n1.  **Inadequate for Plot Extraction:** The retrieval plan's initial step of identifying all \"Person\" nodes is a reasonable starting point for character identification, but it's insufficient for understanding the plot. It prioritizes *who* over *what happened* and *why*.\n2.  **Focus on Static Relationships:** The plan seems geared towards understanding character relationships and interactions rather than the progression of events. Identifying that \"Person A interacts with Person B\" is not the same as understanding the *narrative significance* of that interaction.\n3.  **Failure to Identify Narrative Structure:** The plan doesn't attempt to find nodes or relationships that explicitly represent story elements like conflicts, challenges, goals, or resolutions. The agent needs to be guided to look for verbs that indicate actions and events critical to the plot.\n4.  **Ineffective Search for \"Plot\":** The retrieval plan's attempt to search for \"plot\" directly, resulting in an empty graph, indicates a fundamental mismatch between the query's intent and the graph's structure. The graph doesn't appear to have nodes or tags explicitly labeled \"plot.\"\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Enhance Graph Schema:**\n    *   **Introduce Event Nodes:** Create distinct \"Event\" nodes that can be linked to characters, locations, and objects. These events should have properties like time, cause, and outcome.\n    *   **Develop Narrative Relationship Types:** Incorporate relationships that explicitly convey plot progression, such as `causes_event`, `leads_to_conflict`, `achieves_goal`, `reveals_motivation`, `resolves_conflict`, `precedes`, `follows`.\n    *   **Character Archetypes and Roles:** Distinguish between protagonist, antagonist, supporting characters, etc., to better structure the narrative focus.\n\n2.  **Improve Graph Extraction:**\n    *   Prompt the LLM to identify and extract key plot points, turning points, conflicts, and resolutions from the text, not just entities and static relationships.\n    *   Prioritize extracting action verbs and their direct objects/subjects to build a more dynamic graph.\n\n3.  **Refine Retrieval Strategies:**\n    *   **Event-Centric Exploration:** After identifying key characters, the retrieval plan should prioritize exploring \"Event\" nodes associated with them.\n    *   **Causal and Temporal Pathfinding:** Develop strategies to traverse paths of events using causal and temporal relationships to reconstruct the narrative sequence.\n    *   **Identify Conflict and Resolution:** Specifically look for relationships indicating conflict, opposition, and their subsequent resolutions.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the chunk size can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

It might identify an entity or a relationship in one chunk but miss its broader context or connections present in adjacent chunks.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Your task is to meticulously extract entities and their relationships from the provided text to build a knowledge graph that captures the story's plot and thematic elements.\n\n**Extraction Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Entity Identification and Typing:**\n    *   Identify all significant entities relevant to the narrative.\n    *   Categorize entities into the following types:\n        *   `Character`: Protagonists, antagonists, and important supporting roles.\n        *   `Setting`: Specific locations, time periods, or environments central to the plot.\n        *   `Event`: Key occurrences that drive the plot forward (e.g., 'Conflict', 'Discovery', 'Decision', 'Resolution', 'Inciting Incident').\n        *   `Object`: Items of significant importance (e.g., magical artifacts, crucial documents).\n        *   `Concept`: Abstract ideas or themes (e.g., 'Love', 'Betrayal', 'Justice').\n        *   `Motivation`: The driving force behind a character's actions (e.g., 'Revenge', 'Survival').\n        *   `Goal`: A specific objective a character or group aims to achieve.\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction and Prioritization:**\n    *   Identify relationships between entities that are **narratively significant** and drive the plot. Focus on relationships that indicate:\n        *   **Cause and Effect:** `causes`, `results_in`, `enables`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Actions and Agency:** `performs`, `receives`, `attacks`, `defends`, `informs`, `betrays`, `helps`, `hinders`.\n        *   **Conflict and Resolution:** `conflicts_with`, `opposes`, `resolves`, `confronts`.\n        *   **Motivation and Goals:** `motivates`, `pursues`, `achieves`, `fails_at`.\n        *   **Temporal Order:** `precedes`, `follows`.\n        *   **Association/Involvement:** `involved_in` (for events), `located_in` (for settings).\n    *   For each relationship, provide:\n        *   `source_entity`: The starting entity of the relationship.\n        *   `target_entity`: The ending entity of the relationship.\n        *   `relation_type`: The specific type of narrative relationship (choose from the prioritized list above or similar contextually relevant types).\n        *   `description`: A concise explanation of *why* this relationship is important to the story's progression or understanding.\n        *   `text_evidence`: The exact quote(s) from the text supporting this relationship.\n\n3.  **Event-Centric Representation:**\n    *   Treat significant `Events` as first-class citizens. Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data.

Detail the `Event` entity with a description of what occurred.\n    *   Link `Events` to `Characters`, `Settings`, and `Objects` using appropriate relationship types (e.g., `Character` `participates_in` `Event`, `Event` `occurs_at` `Setting`).\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nPresent the extracted information as a structured list of JSON objects, with separate sections for 'entities' and 'relationships'.\n\n**Example Structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\"id\": \"char_1\", \"type\": \"Character\", \"name\": \"Alice\", \"description\": \"Protagonist\"},\n    {\"id\": \"event_1\", \"type\": \"Event\", \"name\": \"The Heist\", \"description\": \"A daring robbery of the artifact.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"obj_1\", \"type\": \"Object\", \"name\": \"The Amulet\", \"description\": \"An ancient artifact of immense power.\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"char_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"participates_in\",\n      \"description\": \"Alice is the mastermind behind the heist.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Alice meticulously planned every step of the daring heist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source_entity\": \"event_1\",\n      \"target_entity\": \"obj_1\",\n      \"relation_type\": \"involves_object\",\n      \"description\": \"The primary target of the heist was the Amulet.\",\n      \"text_evidence\": \"Their objective was to retrieve the legendary Amulet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFocus solely on generating the structured graph data. Do not include any conversational filler or meta-commentary in your output.\n```", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The current approach is too focused on identifying entities and their direct relationships, rather than uncovering the narrative flow, cause-and-effect, and events that constitute a plot. The plans show a tendency to broaden the search initially and then get stuck in exploring static connections without a clear strategy for identifying dynamic narrative elements.\n\n**Specific Criticisms:**\n\n1.  **Inadequate Focus on Narrative Structure:**\n    *   **Initial Steps:** The initial plan to search for \"Person\" nodes is a good starting point for character identification but doesn't directly address the \"plot.\" Understanding *who* is in the story is different from understanding *what happens* in the story.\n    *   **Subsequent Steps:** Exploring neighbors of specific characters (like Captain Dietrich) provides information about their immediate connections but doesn't necessarily reveal the sequence of events or the overarching narrative arc. Relationships like \"Addressed\" or \"interacts with\" describe interactions but lack the context of *why* or *what the outcome was*, which are crucial for plot.\n\n2.  **Lack of Event and Action Extraction:**\n    *   The query \"What is the plot of the story?\" requires identifying key events, conflicts, motivations, and resolutions.

The current approach is too focused on identifying entities and their direct relationships, rather than uncovering the narrative flow, cause-and-effect, and events that constitute a plot. The plans show a tendency to broaden the search initially and then get stuck in exploring static connections without a clear strategy for identifying dynamic narrative elements.\n\n**Specific Criticisms:**\n\n1.  **Inadequate Focus on Narrative Structure:**\n    *   **Initial Steps:** The initial plan to search for \"Person\" nodes is a good starting point for character identification but doesn't directly address the \"plot.\" Understanding *who* is in the story is different from understanding *what happens* in the story.\n    *   **Subsequent Steps:** Exploring neighbors of specific characters (like Captain Dietrich) provides information about their immediate connections but doesn't necessarily reveal the sequence of events or the overarching narrative arc. Relationships like \"Addressed\" or \"interacts with\" describe interactions but lack the context of *why* or *what the outcome was*, which are crucial for plot.\n\n2.  **Lack of Event and Action Extraction:**\n    *   The query \"What is the plot of the story?\" requires identifying key events, conflicts, motivations, and resolutions. The available functions and the way they are being used do not prioritize or facilitate the extraction of such narrative components.\n    *   The system is not effectively leveraging relationships that might indicate plot progression (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"leads to,\" \"wants to escape,\" \"rescued\"). It seems to explore relationships without a clear prioritization of those that drive the narrative forward.\n\n3.  **Ineffective Use of Keywords and Graph Traversal:**\n    *   The plan to search for the keyword \"plot\" directly (Iteration 3) is a reasonable attempt, but if no nodes or relationships are explicitly tagged with \"plot,\" this step will yield no results, as it did. This highlights a potential gap in how plot information is represented in the graph or a limitation in the keyword search's ability to infer plot from descriptive text.\n    *   The exploration of \"neighbors\" without a strategy to filter or prioritize them based on their relevance to plot development (e.g., focusing on action verbs or event types) leads to a potentially overwhelming amount of tangential information.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Relationships:** When exploring connections, the system should be prompted to look for relationships that imply action, causality, conflict, or resolution (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"killed,\" \"rescues,\" \"leads to,\" \"confronts,\" \"fights\").\n2.  **Focus on Event Nodes:** If events are represented in the graph, strategies to identify and connect them to characters and locations should be employed.\n3.  **Incorporate Temporal or Sequential Information:** If available, relationships that indicate sequence (e.g., \"before,\" \"after\") or chains of events are vital for constructing a plot.\n4.  **Refine Keyword Search:** If a direct keyword search for \"plot\" fails, consider searching for nodes/relationships that describe *actions*, *conflicts*, *goals*, and *outcomes* related to the main characters identified.\n5.  **Contextualize Interactions:** The LLM should be prompted to interpret the *significance* of interactions beyond just their existence.

The current approach is too focused on identifying entities and their direct relationships, rather than uncovering the narrative flow, cause-and-effect, and events that constitute a plot. The plans show a tendency to broaden the search initially and then get stuck in exploring static connections without a clear strategy for identifying dynamic narrative elements.\n\n**Specific Criticisms:**\n\n1.  **Inadequate Focus on Narrative Structure:**\n    *   **Initial Steps:** The initial plan to search for \"Person\" nodes is a good starting point for character identification but doesn't directly address the \"plot.\" Understanding *who* is in the story is different from understanding *what happens* in the story.\n    *   **Subsequent Steps:** Exploring neighbors of specific characters (like Captain Dietrich) provides information about their immediate connections but doesn't necessarily reveal the sequence of events or the overarching narrative arc. Relationships like \"Addressed\" or \"interacts with\" describe interactions but lack the context of *why* or *what the outcome was*, which are crucial for plot.\n\n2.  **Lack of Event and Action Extraction:**\n    *   The query \"What is the plot of the story?\" requires identifying key events, conflicts, motivations, and resolutions. The available functions and the way they are being used do not prioritize or facilitate the extraction of such narrative components.\n    *   The system is not effectively leveraging relationships that might indicate plot progression (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"leads to,\" \"wants to escape,\" \"rescued\"). It seems to explore relationships without a clear prioritization of those that drive the narrative forward.\n\n3.  **Ineffective Use of Keywords and Graph Traversal:**\n    *   The plan to search for the keyword \"plot\" directly (Iteration 3) is a reasonable attempt, but if no nodes or relationships are explicitly tagged with \"plot,\" this step will yield no results, as it did. This highlights a potential gap in how plot information is represented in the graph or a limitation in the keyword search's ability to infer plot from descriptive text.\n    *   The exploration of \"neighbors\" without a strategy to filter or prioritize them based on their relevance to plot development (e.g., focusing on action verbs or event types) leads to a potentially overwhelming amount of tangential information.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Narrative Relationships:** When exploring connections, the system should be prompted to look for relationships that imply action, causality, conflict, or resolution (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"killed,\" \"rescues,\" \"leads to,\" \"confronts,\" \"fights\").\n2.  **Focus on Event Nodes:** If events are represented in the graph, strategies to identify and connect them to characters and locations should be employed.\n3.  **Incorporate Temporal or Sequential Information:** If available, relationships that indicate sequence (e.g., \"before,\" \"after\") or chains of events are vital for constructing a plot.\n4.  **Refine Keyword Search:** If a direct keyword search for \"plot\" fails, consider searching for nodes/relationships that describe *actions*, *conflicts*, *goals*, and *outcomes* related to the main characters identified.\n5.  **Contextualize Interactions:** The LLM should be prompted to interpret the *significance* of interactions beyond just their existence. For instance, \"Captain Dietrich addresses the crew\" is less relevant to plot than \"Captain Dietrich *commands* the crew to *prepare for battle*.\"", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 471 nodes and 708 relationships.

This is crucial and honest.\n*   **Explains *why* it can't provide a plot:** It accurately describes the nature of the provided information as \"fragmented,\" focusing on \"specific events, actions, and relationships rather than a chronological or thematic storyline.\" This gives the user insight into the quality of the source material.\n*   **Mentions key elements:** It correctly identifies \"Noork\" as a central character and hints at \"interactions with various individuals and groups\" and \"struggles within a mysterious setting.\"\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Doesn't attempt to synthesize available information:** While it states a cohesive plot isn't available, it doesn't try to piece together *any* narrative threads that *might* be present, however fragmented.\n*   **Lacks actionable advice for the user:** It doesn't tell the user what they *could* do with the existing information or what kind of information would be needed to construct a plot.\n*   **Could be more specific about the \"fragmented\" nature:** While it explains the fragmentation, it could briefly illustrate it with a hypothetical example or by referencing the *types* of fragments.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal is to make the response more helpful even when the ideal outcome (a plot summary) isn't possible.\n\nHere are several ways to improve the response, ranging from minor tweaks to more significant enhancements:\n\n---\n\n### **Improvement Strategy 1: Enhanced Explanation and Context**\n\nThis strategy focuses on providing a more detailed explanation of *why* a plot can't be formed and offering a more nuanced description of the available content.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information does not contain a complete or cohesive plot summary for the story. While it mentions a central character named Noork and describes various events, interactions with other individuals and groups, and his struggles within a mysterious setting, these elements are presented as disconnected fragments.\n>\n> Instead of a chronological progression or a clear thematic arc, the information appears to focus on specific scenes, character actions, and relational dynamics without weaving them into a singular narrative storyline. Therefore, it's not possible to construct a definitive plot from the data at hand.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Improvement Strategy 2: Attempted Synthesis of Fragmented Information (with caveats)**\n\nThis strategy involves the RAG system trying its best to identify any potential narrative threads, while still clearly stating that it's an incomplete picture.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information doesn't offer a complete plot summary, but we can piece together some narrative elements. The story appears to revolve around a character named Noork, who is engaged in various activities and facing challenges within a mysterious environment.\n>\n> We see fragments of his interactions with different individuals and groups, suggesting potential conflicts or alliances. The information highlights specific events and actions attributed to Noork and others, but these are not presented in a chronological order or linked to a clear beginning, rising action, climax, and resolution.\n>\n> To understand the full plot, more context connecting these fragmented scenes and events would be necessary.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Improvement Strategy 3: Actionable Advice and User Guidance**\n\nThis strategy focuses on informing the user what they *can* do with the information and what might be missing.\n\n**Revised Response Example:**\n\n> \"The provided information details numerous events, character actions, and relationships involving a central figure named Noork within a mysterious setting. However, it does not present a cohesive plot summary.\n>\n> The information is fragmented, focusing on specific moments and interactions rather than a chronological or thematic storyline. This means we can identify elements like:\n>\n> *   **Key Character:** Noork\n> *   **Setting:** A mysterious environment\n> *   **Interactions:** With various individuals and groups\n> *   **Themes:** Struggles and challenges faced by Noork\n>\n> To construct a plot, we would need information that connects these fragments, establishing a clear sequence of events, a central conflict, rising action, a climax, and a resolution. If you have additional context or specific questions about the events mentioned, I may be able to provide more targeted information.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Improvement Strategy 4: Combination of Strategies (Most Recommended)**\n\nThis approach combines the strengths of the above strategies for the most comprehensive and helpful response.\n\n**Revised Response Example (Recommended):**\n\n> \"The provided information contains details about a character named Noork, his involvement with various individuals and groups, and his struggles within a mysterious setting. However, it does not offer a cohesive plot summary.\n>\n> The data is presented as fragmented pieces, focusing on specific events, actions, and relationships rather than a continuous, chronological storyline with a clear beginning, rising action, climax, and resolution.\n>\n> **What we can glean from the fragments:**\n> *   **Central Character:** Noork\n> *   **General Setting:** A mysterious and possibly challenging environment.\n> *   **Key Activities:** Interactions with diverse entities and facing various struggles.\n>\n> **Why a plot summary isn't possible:** Without connecting the dots between these disparate pieces, it's impossible to determine the overarching narrative arc, the main conflict driving the story, or how events unfold sequentially.\n>\n> **To improve the response for future queries:** If you are seeking a plot summary, please ensure the source material provides a more structured narrative. If you have specific questions about the events or characters mentioned, I can try to extract that information from the existing fragments.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Underlying Principles for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Be Transparent:** Clearly state what information is *missing*.\n2.  **Explain the \"Why\":** Elaborate on the nature of the missing information (fragmented, non-chronological, etc.).\n3.  **Synthesize What's Available:** Even if incomplete, try to offer what *can* be understood from the data.\n4.  **Provide Context/Examples:** Briefly illustrate *how* the information is fragmented.\n5.  **Guide the User:** Suggest what kind of information would be needed to fulfill their request or what the RAG system *can* do with the current data.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system can provide a more informative and user-friendly response, even when it cannot fully satisfy the original query.", "system_prompt_length": 623, "user_prompt_length": 65, "response_length": 7087, "metadata": {"original_query": "What is the plot of the story?", "generated_answer_length": 380, "evaluation_length": 7087}}

For down there moved alertly a golden skinned girl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a sheathed dagger. Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine contours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the insignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration. Not forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged cliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest, and the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had confirmed that belief. For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of the cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour the great bird.

And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrichâ€”whose memory was gone completelyâ€”again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large.

The spotted narl attacking the girl and Noork killing it formed the 'attacked' and 'killed' relationships respectively.

The actions of the men from Wari clearly show an 'attacks' relationship towards Von Mark's group. Gurn's revelation leads to Noork's freedom, hence 'freed by'. Tholon Sarna's statement identifies her as Gurn's sister, creating a 'related to' relationship. The Vasads' description explicitly states their loyalty to Gurn, forming a 'serves' relationship. Finally, the mention of Ud carrying a message to Gurn establishes a 'carried message to' relationship. These relationships were then summarized into triplets for a structured representation.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray volcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us. But of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by Luna's bulk, we know little. Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in diameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its meaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere.

The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge.

process involved first identifying all potential entities in the text, categorizing them by type (Person, Organization, Location, Artifact, Vehicle, Concept), and extracting relevant properties. For example, 'The Doctor' is a Person with properties like 'role' and 'occupation'. 'Sekk' is a Location with a 'description'. 'The Doctor's crude space-ships' is a Vehicle with 'type' and 'description'. Next, relationships between these identified entities were established based on explicit mentions and contextual clues in the text. Each relationship was assigned a type (e.g., 'travels with', 'pilots', 'lands on'), a description explaining the connection, and supporting evidence directly from the text. Finally, key relationships were condensed into subject-predicate-object triplets for a concise representation of the extracted information. The reasoning behind the 'New York' identification is that the text explicitly links it to Noork's past through the Vasads. The battered wrist watch is linked to Noork as the only remaining item of his 'Earthly garb'.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 0, "user_prompt_length": 1966, "response_length": 8864, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 1118, "mode": "creation"}}

It only offers a list of characters and some limited interactions, primarily focusing on Captain Dietrich's relationships and his stated origins.\nFeedback: Here's an evaluation of the RAG response and suggestions for improvement:\n\n## Evaluation of the Response:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Honest and Direct:** The response accurately identifies that the provided context is insufficient for answering the query. This is a crucial function of a RAG system â€“ it shouldn't hallucinate or invent information.\n*   **Specific about Limitations:** It doesn't just say \"not enough information.\" It specifies *what kind* of information is missing (plot details) and *what information is present* (character list, limited interactions, Captain Dietrich's origins). This gives the user more context about the system's capabilities and the limitations of the source material it accessed.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Potentially Too Brief:** While accurate, the response could be perceived as a bit dismissive. A user asking for the plot likely wants *some* narrative context, even if it's just a summary of the available fragments.\n*   **Missed Opportunity for Partial Information:** Even if a full plot isn't available, the system could have potentially synthesized a *partial* plot or a description of the *setup* of the story based on the character interactions.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nThe goal of the improvement is to make the response more helpful and informative, even when the full answer isn't available, while still being truthful about the limitations.\n\nHere are a few ways to improve the response, ranging from minor tweaks to more substantial enhancements:\n\n---\n\n**Improvement 1: Add a Tentative Summary of Available Narrative Elements**\n\nInstead of just stating what's missing, try to piece together what *is* there, framing it as the current understanding based on the limited context.\n\n**Original Response:**\n> The provided information does not contain enough details to describe the plot of the story. It only offers a list of characters and some limited interactions, primarily focusing on Captain Dietrich's relationships and his stated origins.\n\n**Improved Response (Option A):**\n> The provided information does not contain enough details to fully describe the plot of the story. Based on the available context, we can understand that the narrative involves a character named Captain Dietrich, whose origins are mentioned. There are also references to his relationships and some limited interactions with other characters, but a complete storyline or central conflict is not detailed.\n\n**Why this is better:** It still clearly states the limitation but also offers a bit more substance by summarizing the *types* of narrative elements that *are* present.\n\n---\n\n**Improvement 2: Suggest What Kind of Information Would Be Needed**\n\nThis helps the user understand how to potentially get a better answer in the future, either by refining their query or providing more context.\n\n**Improved Response (Option B):**\n> The provided information does not contain enough details to describe the plot of the story. It offers a list of characters and some limited interactions, primarily focusing on Captain Dietrich's relationships and his stated origins. To understand the plot, more information about the story's events, goals, conflicts, and resolutions would be needed.\n\n**Why this is better:** It educates the user on what constitutes \"plot\" in this context, guiding them for future interactions.\n\n---\n\n**Improvement 3: Combine Summarization and Guidance**\n\nThis offers the most comprehensive and helpful approach.\n\n**Improved Response (Option C):**\n> The provided information is insufficient to describe the complete plot of the story. While it lists characters and mentions some limited interactions, particularly concerning Captain Dietrich's relationships and stated origins, it does not outline the story's central conflict, sequence of events, or ultimate resolution. To generate a plot summary, additional details regarding the narrative arc, key plot points, and character motivations would be required.\n\n**Why this is better:** It's clear, specific about the limitations, and constructively guides the user on what kind of information would be necessary to answer their original query effectively.\n\n---\n\n**Improvement 4 (More advanced, if the RAG system can infer a *premise*):**\n\nIf the limited interactions *do* suggest a starting point or a general theme, the RAG could infer that. This is riskier as it can lead to over-interpretation, but can be very helpful if done carefully.\n\n**Improved Response (Option D - requires careful inference):**\n> The provided information does not contain enough details to describe the full plot of the story. However, it does establish the presence of Captain Dietrich, whose origins are noted, and hints at relationships and interactions that form part of the narrative. The available context suggests a focus on character dynamics around Captain Dietrich, but the overarching storyline, conflicts, and outcomes are not detailed. Additional context detailing the story's events, goals, and resolutions would be needed for a comprehensive plot summary.\n\n**Why this is better:** It offers a slightly more narrative-oriented interpretation of what *is* present (\"focus on character dynamics\") without overstepping into inventing plot points.\n\n---\n\n**Key Principles for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Be Helpful, Not Just Accurate:** Aim to provide as much value as possible within the constraints.\n*   **Be Specific:** Clearly state *why* the query can't be answered.\n*   **Guide the User:** Offer suggestions on what information is needed or how they might refine their query.\n*   **Avoid Hallucination:** Never invent plot details if they aren't present in the source.\n*   **Consider the User's Intent:** A user asking for a plot wants a story outline. Even if that's impossible, provide what you *can* about the narrative elements.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the RAG system's response becomes more user-friendly and informative, even when it cannot directly fulfill the user's request.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the retrieved content can be improved.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing. Focus on the most critical points and be concise.", "user_prompt": "Please provide your critique and feedback.", "llm_response": "## Critique of Retrieved Context and Suggestions for Improvement:\n\nThe current retrieved context is heavily focused on identifying entities and their immediate, stated connections, particularly around Captain Dietrich. While this is a necessary first step in graph construction, it's insufficient for answering a query about the \"plot\" of the story.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the issues and how to improve:\n\n**1. Lack of Relational Depth and Nuance:**\n*   **Problem:** The retrieved context primarily lists node connections with generic relation types like \"interacts with\" or \"from.\" The textual evidence often supports these, but it rarely captures the *purpose* or *implication* of these interactions within a narrative. For instance, \"interacts with\" between Captain Dietrich and Doctor Von Mark is mentioned, but the nature of this interaction (e.g., conflict, alliance, interrogation) is crucial for plot understanding and is not sufficiently detailed.\n*   **Improvement:** The LLM agent exploring the graph should prioritize extracting richer relational information. This means going beyond simple labels and capturing the *type* of interaction (e.g., \"warns,\" \"confronts,\" \"helps,\" \"deceives\") and the *context* of that interaction as described in the text. The relation descriptions should be more descriptive, e.g., \"Doctor Von Mark warns Captain Dietrich about pretense\" rather than just \"interacts with.\"\n\n**2. Missing Global Narrative Structure:**\n*   **Problem:** The retrieved context is fragmented. It lists entities and their direct links but fails to connect these into a coherent sequence of events or a central conflict. There's no information about the inciting incident, rising action, climax, or resolution. The system is essentially providing a character list with some annotations, not a narrative summary.\n*   **Improvement:** The graph exploration strategy needs to be more sophisticated. Instead of just exploring immediate neighbors, the agent should be guided to:\n    *   **Identify key events:** Look for actions, dialogues, or descriptions that indicate significant plot developments.\n    *   **Track character goals and motivations:** Extract information that explains *why* characters are doing what they are doing.\n    *   **Establish causal links:** Understand how one event leads to another. This could involve identifying nodes representing events and linking them sequentially or by cause-and-effect.\n    *   **Community Detection/Centrality:** While community detection is a function, it should be applied to find groups of characters involved in specific subplots or to identify central characters whose actions drive the main plot.\n\n**3. Over-reliance on Individual Statements:**\n*   **Problem:** Many extracted relations are based on direct quotes or simple statements (e.g., \"Captain Dietrich states he is from...\"). While this is accurate, it doesn't necessarily reveal the plot. A plot involves more than just characters stating facts about themselves; it involves actions, reactions, and unfolding circumstances.\n*   **Improvement:** The LLM agent needs to infer plot elements from a combination of statements and actions. For example, if Captain Dietrich states he is from \"America\" and later interacts with characters in a \"Jungle,\" the agent should try to infer potential conflicts or narrative arcs related to this disparity or journey, rather than just recording the \"from\" relation.\n\n**4. Insufficient Contextualization for the Final LLM:**\n*   **Problem:** The final LLM receives a collection of graph explorations. If these explorations are not curated to highlight narrative progression, the LLM will understandably struggle to synthesize a plot. The current output of \"G describes a graph...\" is very raw.\n*   **Improvement:** The graph exploration phase should actively *summarize* or *select* the most relevant nodes and edges that contribute to a narrative understanding. This could involve:\n    *   Providing a sequence of key events as nodes in the graph.\n    *   Highlighting the relationships that define the main conflict or journey.\n    *   Presenting a condensed subgraph focused on the main protagonist and their key interactions related to the unfolding story.\n\nIn essence, the current system is good at building a knowledge graph of entities and their direct attributes/relationships. However, it needs to evolve to understand and extract *narrative structure* and *events* from the text to answer plot-related queries effectively. This requires a more goal-directed graph exploration focused on identifying plot points rather than just entities and their immediate connections.", "system_prompt_length": 12449, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 4645, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 12290, "enhanced_prompt_length": 12449, "response_length": 4645}}

The plot is typically driven by the actions and interactions of characters. Therefore, the first step should be to identify all the 'Person' nodes in the graph to understand the characters involved.\nMove 2: The previous step returned a list of nodes, and their connections have not been explored. To understand the plot, I need to explore the connections of these nodes. Starting with 'Captain Dietrich' seems like a reasonable first step to uncover more information about the story.\nMove 3: The query asks for the plot of the story. The previous steps have explored some of the main characters and their immediate connections. To understand the plot, it's crucial to explore the relationships and interactions of the central character, Captain Dietrich, further. Therefore, calling get_neighbors on 'Captain Dietrich' is the most logical next step to uncover more details about the story's events and their connections.\nRetrieved Context: \n\nIteration 1 results:\nG describes a graph among nodes Captain Dietrich, Dietrich, Doctor Karl Von Mark, Doctor Von Mark, GENE ELLERMAN, Greg Weeks, Gurn, High Priest, Mary Meehan, Noork, Rold, Sarna, Stephen Dietrich, The Doctor, The High Priest, Tholon Dist, Tholon Sarna, Von Mark, Zurans, girl, golden-skinned slaves, guard, holy man, invisible guards, priests, prisoners, slave women, the girl, the guards, the priest, the slave, two warriors, white man, young American pilot, young women.

While this is accurate, it doesn't necessarily reveal the plot. A plot involves more than just characters stating facts about themselves; it involves actions, reactions, and unfolding circumstances.\n*   **Improvement:** The LLM agent needs to infer plot elements from a combination of statements and actions. For example, if Captain Dietrich states he is from \"America\" and later interacts with characters in a \"Jungle,\" the agent should try to infer potential conflicts or narrative arcs related to this disparity or journey, rather than just recording the \"from\" relation.\n\n**4. Insufficient Contextualization for the Final LLM:**\n*   **Problem:** The final LLM receives a collection of graph explorations. If these explorations are not curated to highlight narrative progression, the LLM will understandably struggle to synthesize a plot. The current output of \"G describes a graph...\" is very raw.\n*   **Improvement:** The graph exploration phase should actively *summarize* or *select* the most relevant nodes and edges that contribute to a narrative understanding. This could involve:\n    *   Providing a sequence of key events as nodes in the graph.\n    *   Highlighting the relationships that define the main conflict or journey.\n    *   Presenting a condensed subgraph focused on the main protagonist and their key interactions related to the unfolding story.\n\nIn essence, the current system is good at building a knowledge graph of entities and their direct attributes/relationships. However, it needs to evolve to understand and extract *narrative structure* and *events* from the text to answer plot-related queries effectively. This requires a more goal-directed graph exploration focused on identifying plot points rather than just entities and their immediate connections.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the retrieval plan can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing. Focus on the most critical points and be concise.", "user_prompt": "Please provide your critique and feedback.", "llm_response": "This retrieval plan is a good starting point for understanding the entities and their direct relationships. However, for a query about the \"plot\" of a story, it needs significant improvement.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique and suggestions:\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Entities over Events:** The plan heavily prioritizes identifying \"Person\" nodes and then exploring their immediate connections. While characters are central to a plot, the current approach misses the *actions*, *events*, and *interactions* that constitute the plot itself. The retrieved context lists connections but doesn't explain *what happened* between characters or *why*.\n2.  **Shallow Relationship Extraction:** The relations extracted are often basic (e.g., \"interacts with,\" \"from,\" \"embraced\"). The textual evidence supports these, but the *narrative significance* of these interactions is lost. For example, knowing Captain Dietrich \"interacts with\" Doctor Von Mark is less useful than knowing *how* they interact (e.g., confrontation, warning, cooperation) and what that interaction means for the story.\n3.  **Lack of Narrative Flow:** The retrieval plan, as demonstrated by the output, results in a collection of nodes and their direct neighbors. There's no clear indication of a temporal sequence, cause-and-effect, or the development of a conflict or resolution. It's a static snapshot of relationships, not a dynamic narrative.\n4.  **Over-reliance on Direct Statements:** The plan seems to capture information directly stated by characters (e.g., \"Captain Dietrich states he is from...\"). While important, plots are often revealed through actions, dialogue with subtext, and unfolding circumstances, not just direct self-declarations.\n5.  **Insufficient Context for Final LLM:** The final LLM receives a graph that is essentially a list of nodes and their immediate neighbors with basic relation types. This is too granular and lacks the synthesized understanding needed to answer a complex query like \"plot.\"\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Event and Action Extraction:** Instead of just finding all \"Person\" nodes, the initial moves should aim to identify nodes representing *events*, *actions*, or *plot points*. These nodes should then be explored to see which entities are involved and what the outcome or context of the event is.\n2.  **Extract Richer, Contextualized Relations:** The LLM agent needs to be guided to extract relation types that describe the *nature* and *purpose* of interactions. For example, instead of \"interacts with,\" aim for relations like \"confronts,\" \"warns,\" \"helps,\" \"deceives,\" \"discovers,\" \"travels to,\" etc. The relation description should include the *narrative implication* derived from the textual evidence.\n3.  **Implement a Narrative Traversal Strategy:** The agent should not just explore neighbors randomly or based on entity type. It should employ a strategy that follows narrative threads. This could involve:\n    *   Identifying an inciting incident and tracing its consequences.\n    *   Following a character's journey or conflict.\n    *   Using community detection to understand subplots and then linking them to the main plot.\n4.  **Incorporate Causal and Temporal Links:** Explicitly try to identify and represent causal relationships (A caused B) and temporal sequencing (Event X happened before Event Y). This could be achieved by adding specific node/relation types for these concepts.\n5.  **Synthesize Information During Retrieval:** The retrieval phase should aim to provide a more condensed, narrative-focused summary of the graph exploration. This could involve presenting a subgraph highlighting key plot drivers, a sequence of significant events, or a summary of character motivations related to the central conflict, rather than raw node-neighbor lists.\n\nIn short, the system needs to move from a purely entity-centric graph construction to a more *event-driven* and *narrative-focused* graph exploration to effectively answer plot-related queries.", "system_prompt_length": 17422, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 4019, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 17263, "enhanced_prompt_length": 17422, "response_length": 4019}}

The most common entity type is \"Location\" with 41 instances. The most frequent relationship type is \"associated with\" with 4 occurrences.\nRetrieval Plan: The query asks for the plot of the story. The previous steps have explored some of the main characters and their immediate connections. To understand the plot, it's crucial to explore the relationships and interactions of the central character, Captain Dietrich, further. Therefore, calling get_neighbors on 'Captain Dietrich' is the most logical next step to uncover more details about the story's events and their connections.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nThis retrieval plan is a good starting point for understanding the entities and their direct relationships. However, for a query about the \"plot\" of a story, it needs significant improvement.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique and suggestions:\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Entities over Events:** The plan heavily prioritizes identifying \"Person\" nodes and then exploring their immediate connections. While characters are central to a plot, the current approach misses the *actions*, *events*, and *interactions* that constitute the plot itself. The retrieved context lists connections but doesn't explain *what happened* between characters or *why*.\n2.  **Shallow Relationship Extraction:** The relations extracted are often basic (e.g., \"interacts with,\" \"from,\" \"embraced\"). The textual evidence supports these, but the *narrative significance* of these interactions is lost. For example, knowing Captain Dietrich \"interacts with\" Doctor Von Mark is less useful than knowing *how* they interact (e.g., confrontation, warning, cooperation) and what that interaction means for the story.\n3.  **Lack of Narrative Flow:** The retrieval plan, as demonstrated by the output, results in a collection of nodes and their direct neighbors. There's no clear indication of a temporal sequence, cause-and-effect, or the development of a conflict or resolution. It's a static snapshot of relationships, not a dynamic narrative.\n4.  **Over-reliance on Direct Statements:** The plan seems to capture information directly stated by characters (e.g., \"Captain Dietrich states he is from...\"). While important, plots are often revealed through actions, dialogue with subtext, and unfolding circumstances, not just direct self-declarations.\n5.  **Insufficient Context for Final LLM:** The final LLM receives a graph that is essentially a list of nodes and their immediate neighbors with basic relation types. This is too granular and lacks the synthesized understanding needed to answer a complex query like \"plot.\"\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Event and Action Extraction:** Instead of just finding all \"Person\" nodes, the initial moves should aim to identify nodes representing *events*, *actions*, or *plot points*. These nodes should then be explored to see which entities are involved and what the outcome or context of the event is.\n2.  **Extract Richer, Contextualized Relations:** The LLM agent needs to be guided to extract relation types that describe the *nature* and *purpose* of interactions. For example, instead of \"interacts with,\" aim for relations like \"confronts,\" \"warns,\" \"helps,\" \"deceives,\" \"discovers,\" \"travels to,\" etc. The relation description should include the *narrative implication* derived from the textual evidence.\n3.  **Implement a Narrative Traversal Strategy:** The agent should not just explore neighbors randomly or based on entity type. It should employ a strategy that follows narrative threads. This could involve:\n    *   Identifying an inciting incident and tracing its consequences.\n    *   Following a character's journey or conflict.\n    *   Using community detection to understand subplots and then linking them to the main plot.\n4.  **Incorporate Causal and Temporal Links:** Explicitly try to identify and represent causal relationships (A caused B) and temporal sequencing (Event X happened before Event Y). This could be achieved by adding specific node/relation types for these concepts.\n5.  **Synthesize Information During Retrieval:** The retrieval phase should aim to provide a more condensed, narrative-focused summary of the graph exploration. This could involve presenting a subgraph highlighting key plot drivers, a sequence of significant events, or a summary of character motivations related to the central conflict, rather than raw node-neighbor lists.\n\nIn short, the system needs to move from a purely entity-centric graph construction to a more *event-driven* and *narrative-focused* graph exploration to effectively answer plot-related queries.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique that will be used to improve the retrieval planning prompt.  \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing. Focus on the most critical points and be concise.", "user_prompt": "Please provide your critique and feedback.", "llm_response": "Critique of Retrieval Plans for \"What is the plot of the story?\":\n\nThe executed retrieval plans exhibit a significant disconnect between the query (\"What is the plot of the story?\") and the exploration strategy. The core issue is an over-reliance on identifying entities (specifically \"Person\" nodes) and then exploring their direct connections, rather than focusing on narrative progression, events, and causal relationships that constitute a plot.\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Focus:** The plans consistently begin by searching for \"Person\" nodes and then immediately expanding to their direct neighbors. This approach generates a static network of characters and their immediate associations, but it fails to uncover the *sequence of events*, *conflicts*, or *resolutions* that form a plot. The extracted relationships tend to be descriptive of character attributes or basic interactions (\"interacts with,\" \"father of\") rather than actions driving the narrative.\n\n2.  **Inability to Synthesize Plot Threads:** The retrieved context, even after multiple steps, remains a collection of nodes and their neighbors. There's no mechanism for synthesizing these disparate pieces of information into a coherent narrative. The system does not prioritize identifying key plot points, character motivations, or the cause-and-effect chains necessary to understand \"what happens.\"\n\n3.  **Missed Opportunities for Event Discovery:** The graph description indicates numerous relationship types that directly imply events and plot progression (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"captured by,\" \"escape destination,\" \"attempts to kill,\" \"warns\"). However, the retrieval plans do not prioritize querying these types or exploring nodes connected by such relationships. The exploration remains too abstract and entity-centric.\n\n4.  **Insufficient Context for the Final LLM:** The final LLM is likely to receive a graph that is rich in character connections but sparse in narrative context. This makes it difficult for the LLM to construct a plot summary from a set of isolated facts and relationships.\n\n**To improve the retrieval planning prompt:**\n\nThe prompt should guide the agent to actively seek out relationship types that indicate actions, events, conflicts, and their consequences.

The core issue is an over-reliance on identifying entities (specifically \"Person\" nodes) and then exploring their direct connections, rather than focusing on narrative progression, events, and causal relationships that constitute a plot.\n\n1.  **Lack of Narrative Focus:** The plans consistently begin by searching for \"Person\" nodes and then immediately expanding to their direct neighbors. This approach generates a static network of characters and their immediate associations, but it fails to uncover the *sequence of events*, *conflicts*, or *resolutions* that form a plot. The extracted relationships tend to be descriptive of character attributes or basic interactions (\"interacts with,\" \"father of\") rather than actions driving the narrative.\n\n2.  **Inability to Synthesize Plot Threads:** The retrieved context, even after multiple steps, remains a collection of nodes and their neighbors. There's no mechanism for synthesizing these disparate pieces of information into a coherent narrative. The system does not prioritize identifying key plot points, character motivations, or the cause-and-effect chains necessary to understand \"what happens.\"\n\n3.  **Missed Opportunities for Event Discovery:** The graph description indicates numerous relationship types that directly imply events and plot progression (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"captured by,\" \"escape destination,\" \"attempts to kill,\" \"warns\"). However, the retrieval plans do not prioritize querying these types or exploring nodes connected by such relationships. The exploration remains too abstract and entity-centric.\n\n4.  **Insufficient Context for the Final LLM:** The final LLM is likely to receive a graph that is rich in character connections but sparse in narrative context. This makes it difficult for the LLM to construct a plot summary from a set of isolated facts and relationships.\n\n**To improve the retrieval planning prompt:**\n\nThe prompt should guide the agent to actively seek out relationship types that indicate actions, events, conflicts, and their consequences. Strategies for traversing the graph should prioritize identifying the inciting incident, character goals, obstacles, and resolutions, rather than just enumerating characters and their basic connections. It should encourage exploring event-related nodes and the entities involved in those events, and then mapping out the causal and temporal relationships between these events.\n\nBased on this critique, generate a new system prompt that will be used to instruct the LLM how to better plan graph retrieval strategies. The system prompt should incorporate the feedback to improve retrieval strategy, function selection, and information gathering.\n\nProvide only the optimized system prompt without additional commentary.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

Do not solely focus on identifying entities like \"Person\" nodes and their static relationships. Instead, actively seek out relationship types that signify events (e.g., \"attacks,\" \"captured by,\" \"warns,\" \"attempts to kill,\" \"causes\").\n\n2.  **Focus on Causal and Temporal Relationships:** Understand that a plot is a chain of cause and effect. Your retrieval plan should aim to uncover these connections. Prioritize exploring nodes and relationships that establish how events lead to one another and the temporal order in which they occur.\n\n3.  **Identify Key Plot Components:** Actively search for information that constitutes the inciting incident, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Look for character goals, obstacles faced, and the ultimate outcomes.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Information Effectively:** Your planned retrieval steps should facilitate the eventual synthesis of information. Aim to gather context that allows an LLM to construct a coherent narrative, not just a collection of isolated facts about entities.\n\n5.  **Strategic Function Selection:** Choose retrieval functions that best support the above objectives.

The plot is typically driven by the actions and interactions of characters. Therefore, the first step should be to identify all the 'Person' nodes in the graph to understand the characters involved.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nThis retrieval plan is a good starting point for understanding the entities and their direct relationships. However, for a query about the \"plot\" of a story, it needs significant improvement.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique and suggestions:\n\n**Critique:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Entities over Events:** The plan heavily prioritizes identifying \"Person\" nodes and then exploring their immediate connections. While characters are central to a plot, the current approach misses the *actions*, *events*, and *interactions* that constitute the plot itself. The retrieved context lists connections but doesn't explain *what happened* between characters or *why*.\n2.  **Shallow Relationship Extraction:** The relations extracted are often basic (e.g., \"interacts with,\" \"from,\" \"embraced\"). The textual evidence supports these, but the *narrative significance* of these interactions is lost. For example, knowing Captain Dietrich \"interacts with\" Doctor Von Mark is less useful than knowing *how* they interact (e.g., confrontation, warning, cooperation) and what that interaction means for the story.\n3.  **Lack of Narrative Flow:** The retrieval plan, as demonstrated by the output, results in a collection of nodes and their direct neighbors. There's no clear indication of a temporal sequence, cause-and-effect, or the development of a conflict or resolution. It's a static snapshot of relationships, not a dynamic narrative.\n4.  **Over-reliance on Direct Statements:** The plan seems to capture information directly stated by characters (e.g., \"Captain Dietrich states he is from...\"). While important, plots are often revealed through actions, dialogue with subtext, and unfolding circumstances, not just direct self-declarations.\n5.  **Insufficient Context for Final LLM:** The final LLM receives a graph that is essentially a list of nodes and their immediate neighbors with basic relation types. This is too granular and lacks the synthesized understanding needed to answer a complex query like \"plot.\"\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Event and Action Extraction:** Instead of just finding all \"Person\" nodes, the initial moves should aim to identify nodes representing *events*, *actions*, or *plot points*. These nodes should then be explored to see which entities are involved and what the outcome or context of the event is.\n2.  **Extract Richer, Contextualized Relations:** The LLM agent needs to be guided to extract relation types that describe the *nature* and *purpose* of interactions. For example, instead of \"interacts with,\" aim for relations like \"confronts,\" \"warns,\" \"helps,\" \"deceives,\" \"discovers,\" \"travels to,\" etc. The relation description should include the *narrative implication* derived from the textual evidence.\n3.  **Implement a Narrative Traversal Strategy:** The agent should not just explore neighbors randomly or based on entity type. It should employ a strategy that follows narrative threads. This could involve:\n    *   Identifying an inciting incident and tracing its consequences.\n    *   Following a character's journey or conflict.\n    *   Using community detection to understand subplots and then linking them to the main plot.\n4.  **Incorporate Causal and Temporal Links:** Explicitly try to identify and represent causal relationships (A caused B) and temporal sequencing (Event X happened before Event Y). This could be achieved by adding specific node/relation types for these concepts.\n5.  **Synthesize Information During Retrieval:** The retrieval phase should aim to provide a more condensed, narrative-focused summary of the graph exploration. This could involve presenting a subgraph highlighting key plot drivers, a sequence of significant events, or a summary of character motivations related to the central conflict, rather than raw node-neighbor lists.\n\nIn short, the system needs to move from a purely entity-centric graph construction to a more *event-driven* and *narrative-focused* graph exploration to effectively answer plot-related queries.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the graph can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing. Focus on the most critical points and be concise.", "user_prompt": "Please provide your critique and feedback.", "llm_response": "Here's a critique of the graph's suitability for answering the \"What is the plot of the story?\" query, focusing on areas for improvement:\n\n**Critique of Graph for Plot Query:**\n\nThe current graph structure, while comprehensive in listing entities and relationships, is not optimally structured for directly answering a \"plot\" query.\n\n1.  **Lack of Explicit Event/Action Nodes:** The graph primarily focuses on entities (People, Locations, Objects) and their static relationships. Crucially, it lacks explicit nodes representing *events*, *actions*, or *plot points* that drive a narrative. For instance, a \"battle,\" \"discovery,\" \"betrayal,\" or \"journey\" are not represented as distinct nodes that can be traversed. This makes it difficult to reconstruct the sequence of events that constitute the plot.\n\n2.  **Shallow Relationship Representation:** Many relationships are generic (e.g., \"associated with,\" \"interacted with,\" \"is\"). While these might be accurate, they lack the narrative depth required to understand *how* and *why* entities are connected in a story. A plot is built on specific, consequential interactions (e.g., \"confronts,\" \"warns,\" \"saves,\" \"hinders,\" \"discovers\"). The abundance of very specific, single-occurrence relationship types (many listed with count '1') suggests a highly granular extraction that might be too noisy or lack thematic grouping.\n\n3.  **Absence of Temporal and Causal Links:** Plots unfold over time and involve cause-and-effect. The graph does not appear to have dedicated mechanisms for representing temporal sequencing (e.g., \"happened before,\" \"followed by\") or causal relationships (e.g., \"caused,\" \"led to\"). Without these, stitching together events into a coherent narrative is challenging.\n\n4.  **Entity-Centric vs. Event-Centric Focus:** The retrieval plan's starting point (identifying \"Person\" nodes) highlights an entity-centric approach. While characters are vital, a plot is fundamentally about *what happens* to them and *what they do*. The graph's structure makes it easier to query \"Who is related to whom?\" than \"What sequence of events occurred?\"\n\n5.  **Granularity of Information:** The sheer number of distinct relationship types, many appearing only once, suggests that the graph might be overly detailed at a granular level without sufficient synthesis. For a plot query, higher-level thematic connections and event sequences are more important than every single minor interaction.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Introduce Event/Action Nodes:** Create dedicated node types for significant plot events (e.g., `Event`, `Action`, `Conflict`, `Discovery`).\n*   **Enrich Relationship Types:** Prioritize relationships that describe narrative progression and character motivations (e.g., `confronts`, `warns`, `betrays`, `travels_to`, `achieves`). Consider consolidating highly specific, low-frequency relationships into broader categories if they represent similar narrative functions.\n*   **Incorporate Temporal and Causal Edges:** Add specific edge types to explicitly link events chronologically or causally.\n*   **Prioritize Narrative Threads:** During graph construction or querying, focus on identifying key plot drivers, character arcs, or central conflicts rather than just listing all entities and their neighbors.\n*   **Consider Subgraph Synthesis:** For plot queries, aim to extract and present cohesive subgraphs that represent a sequence of related events or a significant character arc, rather than fragmented node-relationship lists.", "system_prompt_length": 11811, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 3523, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 11652, "enhanced_prompt_length": 11811, "response_length": 3523}}

The most frequent relationship type is \"associated with\" with 4 occurrences.\n\nThe critique on the graph was: \nHere's a critique of the graph's suitability for answering the \"What is the plot of the story?\" query, focusing on areas for improvement:\n\n**Critique of Graph for Plot Query:**\n\nThe current graph structure, while comprehensive in listing entities and relationships, is not optimally structured for directly answering a \"plot\" query.\n\n1.  **Lack of Explicit Event/Action Nodes:** The graph primarily focuses on entities (People, Locations, Objects) and their static relationships. Crucially, it lacks explicit nodes representing *events*, *actions*, or *plot points* that drive a narrative. For instance, a \"battle,\" \"discovery,\" \"betrayal,\" or \"journey\" are not represented as distinct nodes that can be traversed. This makes it difficult to reconstruct the sequence of events that constitute the plot.\n\n2.  **Shallow Relationship Representation:** Many relationships are generic (e.g., \"associated with,\" \"interacted with,\" \"is\"). While these might be accurate, they lack the narrative depth required to understand *how* and *why* entities are connected in a story. A plot is built on specific, consequential interactions (e.g., \"confronts,\" \"warns,\" \"saves,\" \"hinders,\" \"discovers\"). The abundance of very specific, single-occurrence relationship types (many listed with count '1') suggests a highly granular extraction that might be too noisy or lack thematic grouping.\n\n3.  **Absence of Temporal and Causal Links:** Plots unfold over time and involve cause-and-effect. The graph does not appear to have dedicated mechanisms for representing temporal sequencing (e.g., \"happened before,\" \"followed by\") or causal relationships (e.g., \"caused,\" \"led to\"). Without these, stitching together events into a coherent narrative is challenging.\n\n4.  **Entity-Centric vs. Event-Centric Focus:** The retrieval plan's starting point (identifying \"Person\" nodes) highlights an entity-centric approach. While characters are vital, a plot is fundamentally about *what happens* to them and *what they do*. The graph's structure makes it easier to query \"Who is related to whom?\" than \"What sequence of events occurred?\"\n\n5.  **Granularity of Information:** The sheer number of distinct relationship types, many appearing only once, suggests that the graph might be overly detailed at a granular level without sufficient synthesis. For a plot query, higher-level thematic connections and event sequences are more important than every single minor interaction.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Introduce Event/Action Nodes:** Create dedicated node types for significant plot events (e.g., `Event`, `Action`, `Conflict`, `Discovery`).\n*   **Enrich Relationship Types:** Prioritize relationships that describe narrative progression and character motivations (e.g., `confronts`, `warns`, `betrays`, `travels_to`, `achieves`). Consider consolidating highly specific, low-frequency relationships into broader categories if they represent similar narrative functions.\n*   **Incorporate Temporal and Causal Edges:** Add specific edge types to explicitly link events chronologically or causally.\n*   **Prioritize Narrative Threads:** During graph construction or querying, focus on identifying key plot drivers, character arcs, or central conflicts rather than just listing all entities and their neighbors.\n*   **Consider Subgraph Synthesis:** For plot queries, aim to extract and present cohesive subgraphs that represent a sequence of related events or a significant character arc, rather than fragmented node-relationship lists.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique that will be used to improve the graph construction prompt. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

While crucial, this focuses the extraction on static elements rather than the dynamic actions and events that form a plot. The prompt doesn't explicitly ask for the extraction of *actions* or *events* as distinct entities.\n\n2.  **Shallow Relationship Extraction:** The prompt asks for relationship \"type\" and \"description,\" but the emphasis seems to be on identifying *any* relation between entities. This leads to a profusion of generic relationships like \"associated with,\" \"is,\" or \"interacted with.\" For a plot, more specific, action-oriented, and consequential relationships (e.g., \"confronts,\" \"saves,\" \"discovers,\" \"travels to,\" \"causes\") are needed. The current prompt doesn't guide the LLM to prioritize these narrative-driving relationships.\n\n3.  **Lack of Temporal/Causal Guidance:** Plots are sequences of events with cause-and-effect. The prompt does not instruct the LLM to identify or represent temporal order (e.g., \"event A happened before event B\") or causal links (e.g., \"action X led to outcome Y\"). This makes reconstructing the narrative flow challenging.\n\n4.  **No Guidance on Plot Significance:** The prompt asks for *all* relationships and entity properties extracted from the text. This can lead to a very dense, potentially noisy graph where minor details obscure the main plot points. There's no mechanism to prioritize or identify events/relationships that are central to the story's progression.\n\n5.  **Implicit Event Handling:** Events are currently only implicitly represented through relationships between entities. For example, a \"battle\" might be inferred from multiple \"attacks\" relationships, but it's not an explicit node that can be queried or traversed as a plot point itself.\n\n**Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Introduce \"Event\" or \"Action\" Entity Type:** Modify the prompt to explicitly ask for the extraction of \"Event\" or \"Action\" entities. These nodes should represent key happenings in the narrative (e.g., \"Discovery,\" \"Conflict,\" \"Journey,\" \"Decision\").\n    *   *Example prompt addition:* \"Also identify significant **Events** or **Actions** that occur, including their name, a brief description, and the entities involved.\"\n\n2.  **Prioritize Narrative Relationships:** Guide the LLM to identify relationships that describe plot progression and causality.\n    *   *Example prompt addition:* \"For relationships, prioritize those that indicate actions, causality, temporal order, conflict, or significant character interaction. Examples include 'confronts', 'travels_to', 'causes', 'discovers', 'warns', 'saves', 'hinders'.\"\n\n3.  **Incorporate Temporal/Causal Attributes:** Instruct the LLM to capture temporal and causal information where evident.\n    *   *Example prompt addition:* \"For relationships and events, note any explicit temporal order (e.g., 'happened before') or causal links ('led to').\"\n\n4.  **Focus on Key Plot Drivers:** Add instructions to identify and potentially tag entities and relationships that are central to the main plot.\n    *   *Example prompt addition:* \"Highlight entities and relationships that appear central to the main narrative arc or conflict.\"\n\n5.  **Structure for Narrative Flow:** Encourage the extraction of sequences of events.\n    *   *Example prompt addition:* \"When extracting relationships between events or entities involved in sequential actions, try to represent the flow of the narrative.\"", "system_prompt_length": 12465, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 3760, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 12306, "enhanced_prompt_length": 12465, "response_length": 3760}}
