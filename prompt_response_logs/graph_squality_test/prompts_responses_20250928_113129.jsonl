An LLM selects the hyperparameters (chunk size). The input text (where the information is located) is split into chunks based on the chosen chunk size. For each chunk, an LLM is used to extract a graph. The graphs are then merged. An LLM agent has access to a set of functions to explore the graph (the set is fixed and includes queries on entities and relations based on type or name, access to neighbors, community detection, and identification of central nodes). The context obtained from the exploration is then passed to an LLM together with the query. The LLM generates an answer.\n\nHere are some examples of retrieval plans, with the retrieved contents:\nRetrieval Plan: Move 1: The query asks for the plot of the story. To understand a story, identifying the main characters (Persons) is a good starting point. Therefore, I will search for all nodes of type 'Person'.\nMove 2: The previous step retrieved a list of all 'Person' nodes. To understand the plot, it's crucial to explore the connections of key characters. 'Captain Dietrich' is a prominent name, so retrieving his neighbors will help uncover initial plot elements related to him.\nMove 3: The query asks for the plot of the story. I have explored Captain Dietrich's neighbors. Now, I need to explore the neighbors of 'Doctor Von Mark' to gather more information about the characters and their interactions, which will help in understanding the plot.\nMove 4: The user is asking for the plot of the story. I should search for nodes that contain the keyword 'story' to find information related to the plot.\nMove 5: The query is about the plot of the story. Since previous attempts to find 'story' directly were unsuccessful, and we have identified key characters and their relationships, exploring the 'is a' relationships can help understand the roles and types of entities involved, which may indirectly shed light on the plot.\nMove 6: The user is asking for the plot of the story. Since the previous attempt to search for 'story' as a keyword returned an empty graph, and 'is a' relationships also returned empty, I need to explore other types of nodes that might contain information about the plot. 'Concept' nodes are a good candidate as they often represent abstract ideas or themes that could be related to a story's plot. Therefore, I will search for all nodes of type 'Concept'.\nRetrieved Context: \n\nIteration 1 results:\nG describes a graph among nodes Captain Dietrich, Dietrich, Doctor Karl Von Mark, Doctor Von Mark, Friends, Golden skinned girl, Greg Weeks, Gurn, High Priest, Lornu, Mary Meehan, Noork, Rold, Sarna, Slaves, Stephen Dietrich, The Misty One, Tholon Dist, Tholon Sarna, Ud, Unseen foe, Von Mark, Zurans, common citizens, dead man, evil man, girl, golden men, guard on his left, guard on his right hand, guards, invisible guards, men, men of Zuran, other man, priests, slave women, sleeping guards, temple guards, the girl, the priests, two bodies, unseen man, warriors, young American flier.

However, the subsequent moves show a lack of coherence and strategic depth in exploring the graph.\n\n*   **Redundancy and Inefficiency:** Move 2 focuses on \"Captain Dietrich\" and Move 3 on \"Doctor Von Mark.\" While these are important characters, the plan doesn't explain *why* their neighbors are being explored specifically for the \"plot\" of the story at this stage, beyond a general notion of uncovering \"connections\" and \"interactions.\" The retrieved context in Move 2 and Move 3 primarily shows direct relationships (e.g., \"Addresses,\" \"From/Native Valley,\" \"Hunting/Killed\") rather than narrative elements.\n\n*   **Unclear Search Rationale:** Move 4's attempt to directly search for the keyword \"story\" is a blunt approach and doesn't leverage graph structures effectively. Similarly, Move 5's exploration of \"is a\" relationships, while a valid graph traversal technique, is not well-justified in the context of finding a \"plot.\" The system then abandons this for \"Concept\" nodes in Move 6, again without a clear link to plot extraction.\n\n*   **Missed Opportunities in Graph Exploration:** The system retrieved significant information about Doctor Von Mark's intentions (conquering Earth, making the Fatherland invincible using invisibility) in Iteration 3. This is a crucial plot point related to conflict and ambition, but the plan didn't explicitly pursue it. The agent should have focused on these discovered intentions and their potential consequences.\n\n*   **Lack of Iterative Refinement:** The plan jumps between exploring characters, searching for keywords, and examining relationship types without a clear feedback loop. After identifying specific intentions or conflicts (like Von Mark's plan), the agent should have formulated follow-up queries to explore these threads further (e.g., \"Who opposes Doctor Von Mark's plan?\", \"What is the 'secret of invisibility'?\").\n\n*   **Over-reliance on Node Types:** The strategy leans heavily on node types ('Person', 'Concept') or keywords ('story') rather than utilizing the rich relational information present in the graph (Iterations 2 and 3). Discoveries like \"plans to conquer\" or specific character interactions should drive subsequent exploration.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Hypothesis", "system_prompt_length": 19246, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 2426, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 19087, "enhanced_prompt_length": 19246, "response_length": 2426}}

An LLM agent has access to a set of functions to explore the graph (the set is fixed and includes queries on entities and relations based on type or name, access to neighbors, community detection, and identification of central nodes). The context obtained from the exploration is then passed to an LLM together with the query.

However, the subsequent moves show a lack of coherence and strategic depth in exploring the graph.\n\n*   **Redundancy and Inefficiency:** Move 2 focuses on \"Captain Dietrich\" and Move 3 on \"Doctor Von Mark.\" While these are important characters, the plan doesn't explain *why* their neighbors are being explored specifically for the \"plot\" of the story at this stage, beyond a general notion of uncovering \"connections\" and \"interactions.\" The retrieved context in Move 2 and Move 3 primarily shows direct relationships (e.g., \"Addresses,\" \"From/Native Valley,\" \"Hunting/Killed\") rather than narrative elements.\n\n*   **Unclear Search Rationale:** Move 4's attempt to directly search for the keyword \"story\" is a blunt approach and doesn't leverage graph structures effectively. Similarly, Move 5's exploration of \"is a\" relationships, while a valid graph traversal technique, is not well-justified in the context of finding a \"plot.\" The system then abandons this for \"Concept\" nodes in Move 6, again without a clear link to plot extraction.\n\n*   **Missed Opportunities in Graph Exploration:** The system retrieved significant information about Doctor Von Mark's intentions (conquering Earth, making the Fatherland invincible using invisibility) in Iteration 3. This is a crucial plot point related to conflict and ambition, but the plan didn't explicitly pursue it. The agent should have focused on these discovered intentions and their potential consequences.\n\n*   **Lack of Iterative Refinement:** The plan jumps between exploring characters, searching for keywords, and examining relationship types without a clear feedback loop. After identifying specific intentions or conflicts (like Von Mark's plan), the agent should have formulated follow-up queries to explore these threads further (e.g., \"Who opposes Doctor Von Mark's plan?\", \"What is the 'secret of invisibility'?\").\n\n*   **Over-reliance on Node Types:** The strategy leans heavily on node types ('Person', 'Concept') or keywords ('story') rather than utilizing the rich relational information present in the graph (Iterations 2 and 3). Discoveries like \"plans to conquer\" or specific character interactions should drive subsequent exploration.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Hypothesis\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique that will be used to improve the retrieval planning prompt.  \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

For example, after discovering Von Mark's plan, the next logical steps would involve searching for entities that interact with or oppose this plan, rather than seeking a generic \"story\" node.\n\n5.  **Repetitive and Unproductive Steps:** While the prompt asks to avoid repetition, the *type* of exploration often circles back to less productive avenues without building on prior discoveries.\n\n**To improve the prompt:**\n\n*   **Emphasize Hypothesis Generation:** Instruct the agent to form hypotheses about the plot based on retrieved information and use these hypotheses to guide subsequent searches.\n*   **Prioritize Actionable Discoveries:** Guide the agent to focus on plot-driving elements like conflicts, motivations, plans, and significant events, and to explore their direct connections.\n*   **Promote Iterative Refinement:** Encourage the agent to analyze the *meaning* of retrieved context and use it to refine the search strategy, rather than making isolated, unconnected calls.\n*   **Define \"Plot\" in Graph Terms:** Explicitly suggest looking for chains of events, character motivations, conflicts, and resolutions as indicators of plot.\n\nBased on this critique, generate a new system prompt that will be used to instruct the LLM how to better plan graph retrieval strategies.

The context obtained from the exploration is then passed to an LLM together with the query. The LLM generates an answer.\n\nHere are the queries, the graph and the retrieval plans generated by the agent. \nQuery: What is the plot of the story?\nGraph Description: This graph contains 187 nodes and 398 relationships. The graph density is 0.0229, indicating a sparsely connected network. The graph is fully connected with a fragmentation index of 0.0000. The most frequent entity types are 68 \"Location\"s, 45 \"Person\"s, 31 \"Concept\"s, 20 \"Object\"s, 4 \"Organization\"s, 3 \"Clothing\"s, 2 \"Anatomical\"s, 2 \"Creature\"s, 2 \"Weapon\"s, 1 \"Corpse\", 1 \"Event\", 1 \"Group\", 1 \"Material\", 1 \"People\", and 1 \"Periodical\". The most frequent relationship types are 6 \"associated with\" relationships, 6 \"attacked\" relationships, 6 \"from\" relationships, 6 \"located in\" relationships, 6 \"wears\" relationships, 5 \"is a\" relationships, 5 \"possesses\" relationships, 4 \"with\" relationships, 4 \"climb\" relationships, 4 \"interacted with\" relationships, 4 \"interacts with\" relationships, 4 \"observes\" relationships, 3 \"attacks\" relationships, 3 \"produced\" relationships, and 3 \"captured\" relationships.\nRetrieval Plan: The query asks for the plot of the story. To understand a story, identifying the main characters (Persons) is a good starting point. Therefore, I will search for all nodes of type 'Person'.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nHere's a critique of the retrieval plan:\n\nThe initial strategy of retrieving all 'Person' nodes (Move 1) is a reasonable starting point for understanding a narrative. However, the subsequent moves show a lack of coherence and strategic depth in exploring the graph.\n\n*   **Redundancy and Inefficiency:** Move 2 focuses on \"Captain Dietrich\" and Move 3 on \"Doctor Von Mark.\" While these are important characters, the plan doesn't explain *why* their neighbors are being explored specifically for the \"plot\" of the story at this stage, beyond a general notion of uncovering \"connections\" and \"interactions.\" The retrieved context in Move 2 and Move 3 primarily shows direct relationships (e.g., \"Addresses,\" \"From/Native Valley,\" \"Hunting/Killed\") rather than narrative elements.\n\n*   **Unclear Search Rationale:** Move 4's attempt to directly search for the keyword \"story\" is a blunt approach and doesn't leverage graph structures effectively. Similarly, Move 5's exploration of \"is a\" relationships, while a valid graph traversal technique, is not well-justified in the context of finding a \"plot.\" The system then abandons this for \"Concept\" nodes in Move 6, again without a clear link to plot extraction.\n\n*   **Missed Opportunities in Graph Exploration:** The system retrieved significant information about Doctor Von Mark's intentions (conquering Earth, making the Fatherland invincible using invisibility) in Iteration 3. This is a crucial plot point related to conflict and ambition, but the plan didn't explicitly pursue it. The agent should have focused on these discovered intentions and their potential consequences.\n\n*   **Lack of Iterative Refinement:** The plan jumps between exploring characters, searching for keywords, and examining relationship types without a clear feedback loop. After identifying specific intentions or conflicts (like Von Mark's plan), the agent should have formulated follow-up queries to explore these threads further (e.g., \"Who opposes Doctor Von Mark's plan?\", \"What is the 'secret of invisibility'?\").\n\n*   **Over-reliance on Node Types:** The strategy leans heavily on node types ('Person', 'Concept') or keywords ('story') rather than utilizing the rich relational information present in the graph (Iterations 2 and 3). Discoveries like \"plans to conquer\" or specific character interactions should drive subsequent exploration.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Hypothesis\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the graph can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

For example, the \"secret of invisibility\" is mentioned but might not be strongly linked as a key plot device or objective with clear actors and consequences.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Introduce Narrative-Specific Node Types:** Create nodes for \"PlotPoint,\" \"Event,\" \"Conflict,\" \"Goal,\" \"Motivation,\" \"Resolution,\" etc.\n2.  **Enrich Relationship Types:** Add more descriptive relationship types that map directly to narrative functions (e.g., \"initiates_conflict,\" \"pursues_goal,\" \"faces_obstacle,\" \"reveals_secret,\" \"causes_event\").\n3\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the chunk size can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

This means that crucial plot developments, character interactions, or thematic elements that span across multiple sentences or paragraphs might be split into different chunks. When these chunks are processed independently to extract graphs, the LLM might miss the broader context, leading to incomplete or disconnected subgraphs. This directly impacts the generation of narrative-specific nodes and relationships suggested in the critique, as the LLM might not have sufficient context within a single chunk to identify a \"goal,\" \"conflict,\" or a \"cause-and-effect\" chain.\n\n2.  **Loss of Temporal and Sequential Information:** The sequential nature of narrative events is a significant casualty of small chunk sizes. If an event and its immediate consequence are separated by the 150-token boundary, the relationship between them is less likely to be captured explicitly in the extracted graph. This exacerbates the issue of limited temporal or sequential information highlighted in the critique, making it difficult to establish cause-and-effect for plot progression.\n\n3.  **Shallow Extraction of Abstract Concepts and Motivations:** Abstract concepts, character motivations, or subtle plot devices often require a broader contextual understanding. A 150-token chunk might only capture a sentence or two related to these, leading to superficial graph representations. For instance, a character's \"plan to conquer Earth\" might be reduced to a simple \"associated with\" relationship if the motivation and scope of the plan are detailed across several sentences that fall into different chunks.\n\n4.  **Over-reliance on Generic Relationships:** When information is fragmented, the LLM is more likely to default to generic relationship types like \"associated with\" or \"interacted with\" because it lacks the specific context to infer more nuanced narrative connections. The limited scope of each chunk prevents the extraction of richer, narrative-focused relationships.\n\n**Recommendation for Chunk Size Improvement:**\n\nGiven the critique focusing on narrative structure, temporal information, and abstract concepts, a **larger chunk size** would likely be beneficial.

But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

New entities were created for Noork, Sekk, the oval lake, the star-shaped cavity, the Vasads, the publication 'Planet Stories Summer 1945', the author Gene Ellerman, and the producers Greg Weeks and Mary Meehan, and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team. Concepts like 'erase memory', 'end to first existence', 'life on Sekk', and 'jungle growth' were also added. Relationships were established to connect these new entities and concepts, reflecting Noork's erased memory and his goal on Sekk, life's association with the cavity, and the publication details of the story. Properties were added to Luna and the story title. Several relationships were updated or added to reflect these new entities and their connections.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 1931, "user_prompt_length": 3450, "response_length": 15380, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 1186, "existing_graph_summary_length": 911, "mode": "refinement"}}

Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain Dietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil man when my bird died.\" He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The evil man is dead.

Noork grinned. From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not snore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed to a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would not give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the room. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged into the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer here in the artificial light of the flickering torch.

For a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction of the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then they jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to blood-slippery step. The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man with a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more. He sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a half-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps. In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging out, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle on the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion of the upper temple was muted to a murmur.

For instance, the struggle between Noork and Misty One is a key starting point, leading to them falling down the stair. The consequences of this fall, such as the stone smashing flesh and the guard's corpse causing an obstruction, are captured. The text also details Noork's actions after the fall: his killing of 'the other man', his observation of the doorway, and his subsequent decision to enter it prepared for battle. The anticipation of the guard's fellows emerging with swords highlights a potential future conflict. The relationship between the struggle on the stairs and the general noise/confusion of the upper temple was also inferred.\\n\\nI ensured that relationships reflect causality (e.g., 'guard's corpse' CAUSES 'downward course'), sequence (LEADS_TO), participation (PARTICIPATES_IN), and possession (POSSESSES, ACQUIRED).

The text also details actions and motivations, such as Noork's intent to 'Escape over the wall' and his reasons for wearing specific items. Relationships have been created to connect these new entities with existing ones (e.g., Noork wearing 'Uzdon's window') and to describe interactions (e.g., Noork taking the 'girl's' hand). Specific details about characters, like the 'girl's' violet eyes and Noork's multiple layers of clothing and his associated discomfort, have been added as properties. The relationship 'HAS_CONFLICT' has been inferred between Noork and the Misty Ones, and vice-versa, due to the guarding action preventing escape. The causal link between the Misty Ones guarding the wall and preventing slave escapes has also been established. The event of Rold fading from view has been linked to the overarching escape plot.

The steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water dotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two sputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and toward this Noork made his way. He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\" There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide.

Clothing items like 'simple skirt and brief jacket', 'simple band of cloth', 'strip of well-cured leopard hide', and 'strip of well-cured antelope hide' were also identified. Concepts like 'golden people' and groups like 'Misty Ones' were recognized. Key events like 'capture of women' were noted. Relationships were established to connect characters to locations (Noork to prison pit), identify locations within other locations (stone steps lead to prison pit), describe contents of locations (cavern contains water), define object materials (door made of brass strips), and detail character actions (Noork calls out to Sarna, Sarna approaches entrance). Furthermore, the text provides details about the clothing associated with the 'golden people' and how some captured women dressed, establishing relationships between these clothing items and the 'golden people' concept or the captured women. The identification of Tholon Sarna as 'the golden girl' and the act of her approaching the 'metal-barred entrance' were also captured. Noork's observation and identification of Sarna were mapped. The causal chain of the 'capture of women' event originating from the 'Misty Ones' and occurring 'from the mainland' was also established.

Specific actions like sharpening the sword on rocks were also captured. I also noted that Noork's motivations are implied rather than explicit, and the guards are driven by coveting slave women.

Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 187 nodes and 398 relationships.

He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\"\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Be specific and infer causal or narrative significance where possible:\n\n*   **ACTED_ON_BY:** `Character` -> `Action` <- `Character` (e.g., \"Alice\" ACTED_ON_BY \"Bob\")\n*   **HAS_GOAL:** `Character` -> `Goal`\n*   **DRIVEN_BY:** `Character` -> `Motivation`\n*   **PARTICIPATES_IN:** `Character` -> `Event/PlotPoint`\n*   **OCCURS_AT:** `Event/PlotPoint` -> `Location`\n*   **INVOLVES_OBJECT:** `Event/PlotPoint` -> `Object`\n*   **HAS_CONFLICT:** `Character` or `Group` -> `Conflict`\n*   **CAUSES:** `Event/PlotPoint` or `Action` -> `Event/PlotPoint` or `State` (e.g., \"The storm\" CAUSES \"The ship to sink\")\n*   **LEADS_TO:** `Event/PlotPoint` -> `Event/PlotPoint` (Indicates sequential progression)\n*   **RELATED_TO:** `Concept` -> `Concept` (e.g., \"Power\" RELATED_TO \"Corruption\")\n*   **DESCRIBES:** `Character` or `Event/PlotPoint` -> `Concept` (e.g., \"Alice's actions\" DESC", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph. Your goal is to refine and enhance the existing graph by:\n1. Adding new entities and relationships that are mentioned in the text but missing from the graph\n2. Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 187 nodes and 398 relationships.

The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the eye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of rock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for windows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at three distinct levels. Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple. Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another of their number. He\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

The text also provides descriptive details for these entities, like the musky stench from the incense and the slitted apertures on the temple walls, which were added as properties. The relationship between the 'Skull' and 'Skull Temple' was clarified as a structural relationship, with the skull being the object forming the temple.

The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge.

Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine contours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the insignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration. Not forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged cliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest, and the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had confirmed that belief. For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of the cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour the great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death of the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the words that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated them aloud. \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\" The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going back to the bow slung across\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

I have identified new characters like the 'Golden-skinned girl' and 'Noork,' along with their associated items ('Yellow wood bow,' 'Sheathed dagger,' 'Skin-halter,' 'Breech-clout'). New groups ('Hairy Vasads,' 'Apish Vasads') and their leader ('Gurn') have also been introduced. The narrative describes key events and locations such as the 'Huge gleaming bird' carrying Noork to the 'Cliff,' the emergence of 'Fire' that devours the bird, and Noork's escape from the 'Mysterious bird-thing.' Noork's past and his naming by the 'Vasads' after experiencing 'Delirium' and uttering 'New York' are significant plot points. The text also establishes relationships between characters and locations, like Noork living in the 'Jungle world,' being above the 'Valley,' and resting in the 'Jungle giant.' The 'Golden-skinned girl' is depicted observing Noork and preparing to use her weapons in the 'Valley.' Relationships concerning learned languages and memories have been added, such as Noork learning the 'Tongue of the hairy Vasads' and 'Gurn's' tongue, and his memory of 'New York.' The term 'Jungle giant' is identified as a location where Noork is resting. The 'Mysterious bird-thing' is a concept representing the cause of the great bird's demise. 'Talons' are identified as an object used by the bird. 'Concentration' is a concept Noork experiences. 'Forest' is identified as the habitat of the Vasads. The text further details the girl's attire and weaponry, and Noork's actions and beliefs about his past in the jungle. New relationships have been created to connect these entities, reflecting their roles and interactions within the narrative, such as 'POSSESSES,' 'WEARS,' 'LIVES_IN,' 'CARRIED_TO,' 'CAUSES_DEATH_OF,' 'ESCAPED_FROM,' 'NAMED_BY,' 'UTTERED,' 'OBSERVES,' 'IS_ABOVE,' 'IS_IN,' 'RESTING_IN,' 'LEARNED_LANGUAGE_FROM,' 'HAS_MEMORY_OF,' and 'BELIEVES_IN_PAST_PRESENCE_IN'.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 1931, "user_prompt_length": 3396, "response_length": 20239, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 1132, "existing_graph_summary_length": 911, "mode": "refinement"}}
