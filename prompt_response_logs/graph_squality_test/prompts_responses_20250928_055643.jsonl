For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of the cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour the great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death of the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the words that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated them aloud. \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\" The girl heard.

The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the shadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully. For a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction of the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then they jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to blood-slippery step. The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man with a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more. He sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a half-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps. In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging out, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle on the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion of the upper temple was muted to a murmur. So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that had dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to battle\n\nProvide the reasoning that led to your

characters, locations, and abstract concepts. I identified 'Noork' as a person who rides a 'giant bird' into 'Sekk's fertile valleys'. Noork is also looking for an 'other bird' and encounters a 'golden-skinned girl'. The 'Vasads' provide information about the 'other bird', which came from 'space' and landed in a 'land of sunken valleys'. Noork speculates it might be from his former home and hopes finding it will help his memory. The narrative then shifts to 'Stephen Dietrich', a 'red-haired young American flier' with 'gone completely' memory, who is pursuing 'Doctor Karl Von Mark'. Doctor Karl Von Mark is described as the 'last of the Axis criminals at large' and is working in a 'hidden valley' to restore 'Nazidom'. Dietrich's pursuit started from 'rebuilding Greece' and led him to 'Africa' and the 'hidden valley'. Relationships were established based on actions (ridden by, searched for, came upon, told, landed in, thought, wanted to remember, took up trail of, worked in, worked to restore) and descriptors (comes from, is). Triplets were formed by directly mapping these subject-predicate-object relationships from the text.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 0, "user_prompt_length": 2040, "response_length": 10348, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 1136, "mode": "creation"}}

People identified are Noork, the girl, the priest, and a 'white man'. Organizations/groups include the Skull and priests of Uzdon. Concepts include Uzdon itself. Relationships were inferred based on actions and descriptions: how the door was secured, who was speaking to whom, who was facing whom, what items were used or worn, and who belonged to which group. The priest's affiliation with the Skull and Uzdon, and Noork's actions of hearing, drawing his sword, and facing the priest, were key relational points. The priest's dialogue reveals possessions (robes, window) and intentions (threats, commands).

Each entity was assigned a type. Properties were added where the text provided descriptive details. Relationships were then extracted by looking for verbs and prepositions that indicated interaction or connection between entities, such as 'helping', 'climbing', 'asking', 'responding', 'passing', 'proposing', 'agreeing', 'hugging', 'reaching', and 'running ashore'. The description for each relationship explains the inferred connection, and the evidence is the direct quote from the text supporting it.

Here's a breakdown of its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Evaluation of the Current Response:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Honesty and Directness:** The response accurately states that the plot is *not* present in the provided information. This is crucial because it manages user expectations and avoids fabricating information.\n*   **Identifies Available Information:** It correctly points out what *is* present: character relationships and locations. This shows the system understood *some* of the context.\n*   **Provides Specific Examples:** Mentioning \"Doctor Karl Von Mark working to restore Nazidom in a hidden valley\" and \"Stephen Dietrich pursuing Doctor Karl Von Mark\" gives concrete examples of the type of information it *did* find.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Fails to Directly Answer the User's Core Need:** The user asked for the *plot*. While the response explains *why* it can't provide it, it doesn't offer any workaround or further assistance beyond stating the limitation.\n*   **Potentially Misleading (Subtly):** By listing character actions (\"working to restore Nazidom,\" \"pursuing\"), it hints at plot elements, which might lead a user to believe the plot *is* somewhat contained within the information, even if not explicitly stated as a narrative arc.\n*   **Lack of Proactive Help:** A more helpful response would guide the user on what they *could* do next or suggest alternative interpretations of the query.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\nThe goal is to make the response more helpful and user-centric, even when the direct answer isn't available.\n\n1.  **Elaborate on *Why* the Plot is Missing:**\n    *   Instead of just saying \"The provided information does not contain the plot,\" explain *what kind* of information is present that prevents plot extraction.\n    *   **Example Improvement:** \"The provided documents focus on character descriptions, their relationships, and geographical settings rather than a sequential narrative of events. Therefore, a comprehensive plot summary cannot be extracted.\"\n\n2.  **Offer to Summarize the *Available* Information:**\n    *   Since the system identified character relationships and locations, it could offer to synthesize *that* information. This is the closest it can get to a \"plot\" given the constraints.\n    *   **Example Improvement:** \"While a full plot summary is not available, I can describe the known elements based on the text:\n        *   **Key Characters:** Doctor Karl Von Mark, who is actively working to restore Nazidom in a hidden valley, and Stephen Dietrich, who is pursuing Doctor Karl Von Mark.\n        *   **Setting:** A hidden valley is mentioned as the location for Doctor Karl Von Mark's activities.\n        *   **Conflict:** There appears to be a pursuit dynamic between Stephen Dietrich and Doctor Karl Von Mark.\n        *   Would you like me to elaborate on these points?\"\n\n3.  **Guide the User on What Constitutes a \"Plot\":**\n    *   This could help the user refine their query or understand why their current query isn't yielding results.\n    *   **Example Improvement:** \"To provide a plot, the source material would typically need to describe a sequence of events, including a beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. The current information focuses more on establishing characters and their motivations/affiliations.\"\n\n4.  **Suggest Next Steps or Alternative Queries:**\n    *   If the user is looking for *any* narrative, they might be satisfied with a description of the *central conflict* or the *main characters' objectives*.\n    *   **Example Improvement:** \"If you are interested in understanding the core conflict or the main characters' stated goals, I can summarize those aspects based on the available text. Alternatively, if you have specific questions about any of the characters or locations mentioned, I can try to answer those.\"\n\n5.  **Provide a More Structured Response:**\n    *   Use bullet points or clear headings to make the information easier to digest.\n\n**Revised Example Response:**\n\n\"The provided information does not contain a complete plot summary of the story. The documents focus on establishing key characters, their relationships, and certain settings, rather than detailing a narrative sequence of events.\n\nHowever, based on the available text, I can provide the following details:\n\n*   **Central Figures:**\n    *   **Doctor Karl Von Mark:** This character is described as actively working towards the restoration of Nazidom within a hidden valley.\n    *   **Stephen Dietrich:** This character is noted for pursuing Doctor Karl Von Mark.\n*   **Key Conflict Element:** There is an apparent pursuit dynamic between Stephen Dietrich and Doctor Karl Von Mark.\n*   **Setting:** A hidden valley is identified\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the retrieved content can be improved.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

However, they are highly repetitive. The information presented in Iteration 2 is largely reiterated in Iteration 3, with the latter being truncated. This suggests inefficiency in the graph generation or retrieval process, failing to consolidate or present new findings effectively.\n\n2.  **Lack of Narrative Structure:** The information, even in the more connected iterations, describes static relationships and actions (restoring, pursuing, works in). It does not provide a sequence of events, character motivations beyond immediate actions, or a sense of progression, which are essential components of a plot. The \"textual evidence\" is also very sparse, only providing brief phrases.\n\n3.  **Incomplete Graph Exploration:** The system seems to have stopped exploring or retrieving relevant information prematurely. Iteration 1 shows hundreds of unexplored nodes, and Iterations 2 and 3, while showing some connections, are truncated, implying more potentially relevant information was not accessed or presented. A query about the \"plot\" would require understanding the *entire* story's arc, which necessitates exploring more nodes and their connections.\n\n4.  **Entity and Relation Granularity:** While relationships like \"pursuing/is pursuing\" are identified, the context is minimal.

Exploring his neighbors will provide insights into his interactions, actions, and connections, which are crucial for understanding the story's plot.\nMove 3: The user wants to understand the plot of the story. So far, I've identified 'Doctor Karl Von Mark' as a key entity. To uncover the plot, I need to explore the immediate connections of this character. The `get_neighbors` function is the most appropriate next step to see who or what 'Doctor Karl Von Mark' is directly connected to, which will help in building a narrative.\nMove 4: The user is asking for the plot of the story.

Since no specific node is mentioned in the query, a keyword search is the most appropriate next step.\nMove 6: The user is asking for the plot of the story.

This is a critical failure. A query about \"plot\" requires understanding relationships and events, not just a raw list of entities. The plan should have immediately sought to explore connections for key entities identified, rather than simply listing them all as unexplored.\n\n2.  **Repetitive and Incomplete Graph Exploration (Iterations 2 & 3):** While Iterations 2 and 3 begin to show relationships, they are highly redundant and truncated. The information extracted is repetitive, indicating a lack of efficient graph merging or retrieval consolidation. Crucially, the exploration seems to stop prematurely, failing to uncover a comprehensive narrative.\n\n3.  **Lack of Narrative Coherence:** The extracted relationships (e.g., \"pursuing,\" \"works in\") are isolated facts. They do not build a coherent story or explain character motivations or plot progression. For a plot query, the system needs to extract causal links, event sequences, and thematic connections, not just pairwise relationships.\n\n4.  **Failure to Adapt to Query Intent:** The plan seems to have fixated on \"Doctor Karl Von Mark\" after an initial broad search. However, a plot query requires understanding the entire narrative arc, which might involve exploring multiple character arcs, conflicts, and resolutions, not just the immediate connections of one entity. The subsequent empty graph results (Iterations 4-6) indicate a complete breakdown in exploration after the initial, limited success.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relationship Exploration:** Immediately after identifying potential entities, the plan should prioritize exploring their direct and indirect connections. For a \"plot\" query, this means looking for nodes and relations that describe actions, events, conflicts, resolutions, and character interactions.\n\n2.  **Focus on Narrative Elements:** The agent should be guided to look for specific types of information relevant to a plot, such as:\n    *   Nodes representing events or actions.\n    *   Relations indicating causality, sequence, or motivation (e.g., \"causes,\" \"leads to,\" \"because of,\" \"intends to\").\n    *   Identifying protagonists, antagonists, and their core conflicts.\n\n3.  **Iterative Refinement", "system_prompt_length": 11232, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 2556, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 11073, "enhanced_prompt_length": 11232, "response_length": 2556}}

I should search for nodes that contain the keyword 'plot' to see if there's any direct information about it.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nThe retrieval plan can be significantly improved by focusing on **deeper, more relevant exploration** rather than broad, superficial node listing.\n\n**Critique of the Current Plan:**\n\n1.  **Ineffective Initial Node Identification (Iteration 1):** The first iteration returns a massive list of nodes with *no* connections explored. This is a critical failure. A query about \"plot\" requires understanding relationships and events, not just a raw list of entities.

If an initial path yields limited results or becomes repetitive, broaden the search or pivot to other promising entities.\n    *   Prioritize exploring relationships that are indicative of plot progression (e.g., actions, conflicts, goals, motivations, cause-and-effect).\n\n2.  **Relationship-Centric Traversal:**\n    *   Do not solely rely on `get_neighbors`. Actively consider using relationship-specific retrieval functions (e.g., `get_relationships`, `get_nodes_by_relationship`) when appropriate.\n    *   When exploring neighbors, analyze the *types* of relationships connecting entities. These often contain crucial plot information.\n\n3.  **Iterative Refinement and Synthesis:**\n    *   Each retrieval step should build upon previous information. Explain your reasoning for the next step based on the gathered context.\n    *   Aim to synthesize retrieved information to identify key narrative threads, conflicts, and character arcs.\n    *   If a path is exhausted or yields no relevant information, adjust your strategy.\n\n4.  **Direct Information Seeking:**\n    *   If the query involves keywords like \"plot,\" \"story,\" \"summary,\" or similar, consider directly searching for nodes or relationships containing these terms early in the process.\n\n5.  **Function Usage Guidelines:**\n    *   `get_entities_by_type(entity_type: str)`: Use to find initial entities of a specific type (e.g., \"Person\", \"Location\", \"Event\").\n    *   `get_neighbors(entity_id: str, relationship_type: Optional[str] = None)`: Use to explore direct connections of an entity.

To understand the plot, it's essential to identify the main characters involved. Searching for nodes of type 'Person' will provide a list of all characters in the story, which is a good starting point for understanding the narrative.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nThe retrieval plan can be significantly improved by focusing on **deeper, more relevant exploration** rather than broad, superficial node listing.\n\n**Critique of the Current Plan:**\n\n1.  **Ineffective Initial Node Identification (Iteration 1):** The first iteration returns a massive list of nodes with *no* connections explored. This is a critical failure. A query about \"plot\" requires understanding relationships and events, not just a raw list of entities. The plan should have immediately sought to explore connections for key entities identified, rather than simply listing them all as unexplored.\n\n2.  **Repetitive and Incomplete Graph Exploration (Iterations 2 & 3):** While Iterations 2 and 3 begin to show relationships, they are highly redundant and truncated. The information extracted is repetitive, indicating a lack of efficient graph merging or retrieval consolidation. Crucially, the exploration seems to stop prematurely, failing to uncover a comprehensive narrative.\n\n3.  **Lack of Narrative Coherence:** The extracted relationships (e.g., \"pursuing,\" \"works in\") are isolated facts. They do not build a coherent story or explain character motivations or plot progression. For a plot query, the system needs to extract causal links, event sequences, and thematic connections, not just pairwise relationships.\n\n4.  **Failure to Adapt to Query Intent:** The plan seems to have fixated on \"Doctor Karl Von Mark\" after an initial broad search. However, a plot query requires understanding the entire narrative arc, which might involve exploring multiple character arcs, conflicts, and resolutions, not just the immediate connections of one entity. The subsequent empty graph results (Iterations 4-6) indicate a complete breakdown in exploration after the initial, limited success.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Relationship Exploration:** Immediately after identifying potential entities, the plan should prioritize exploring their direct and indirect connections.

While characters are important, a plot is defined by *actions and events*, not just entities. The plan lacks a strategy to identify which characters are central to the narrative or to immediately explore their relationships and actions.\n\n2.  **Lack of Hierarchical or Event-Based Structure:** The graph is a flat collection of entities and relationships. It doesn't explicitly represent plot structure, like acts, scenes, or key plot points. For a \"plot\" query, the system needs to identify sequences of events and causal links, which are not prioritized in the current graph's schema or the retrieval plan.\n\n3.  **Generic Relationship Types:** While there are many relationship types, many are too general (e.g., \"associated with,\" \"interacts with\") or describe static attributes rather than dynamic plot progression. There's a lack of specific relationship types that clearly denote cause-and-effect, sequence, conflict escalation, or resolution. For instance, \"attacks\" is useful, but a \"causes death of\" or \"motivates action\" relationship would be more direct for plot understanding.\n\n4.  **Ineffective Retrieval Strategy for Plot:** The retrieval plan doesn't guide the agent to look for narrative arcs. It should prioritize identifying:\n    *   **Protagonists/Antagonists:** Key figures driving the conflict.\n    *   **Central Conflicts:** The main struggles.\n    *   **Key Events:** Turning points, climaxes, resolutions.\n    *   **Causal Chains:** How one event leads to another.\n\n5.  **Absence of Temporal Information:** Plots unfold over time. The graph lacks any mechanism to represent the sequence of events, making it difficult to reconstruct a chronological narrative.\n\n**Recommendations for Graph Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Introduce Event Nodes:** Create dedicated node types for \"Event,\" \"Action,\" or \"PlotPoint.\" These nodes can link characters, locations, and objects involved in specific occurrences.\n2.  **Develop Causal and Sequential Relationships:** Introduce specific relationship types like `causes`, `leads_to`, `precedes`, `follows`, `motivates`,", "system_prompt_length": 12716, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 2433, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 12557, "enhanced_prompt_length": 12716, "response_length": 2433}}

While characters are important, a plot is defined by *actions and events*, not just entities. The plan lacks a strategy to identify which characters are central to the narrative or to immediately explore their relationships and actions.\n\n2.  **Lack of Hierarchical or Event-Based Structure:** The graph is a flat collection of entities and relationships. It doesn't explicitly represent plot structure, like acts, scenes, or key plot points. For a \"plot\" query, the system needs to identify sequences of events and causal links, which are not prioritized in the current graph's schema or the retrieval plan.\n\n3.  **Generic Relationship Types:** While there are many relationship types, many are too general (e.g., \"associated with,\" \"interacts with\") or describe static attributes rather than dynamic plot progression. There's a lack of specific relationship types that clearly denote cause-and-effect, sequence, conflict escalation, or resolution. For instance, \"attacks\" is useful, but a \"causes death of\" or \"motivates action\" relationship would be more direct for plot understanding.\n\n4.  **Ineffective Retrieval Strategy for Plot:** The retrieval plan doesn't guide the agent to look for narrative arcs. It should prioritize identifying:\n    *   **Protagonists/Antagonists:** Key figures driving the conflict.\n    *   **Central Conflicts:** The main struggles.\n    *   **Key Events:** Turning points, climaxes, resolutions.\n    *   **Causal Chains:** How one event leads to another.\n\n5.  **Absence of Temporal Information:** Plots unfold over time. The graph lacks any mechanism to represent the sequence of events, making it difficult to reconstruct a chronological narrative.\n\n**Recommendations for Graph Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Introduce Event Nodes:** Create dedicated node types for \"Event,\" \"Action,\" or \"PlotPoint.\" These nodes can link characters, locations, and objects involved in specific occurrences.\n2.  **Develop Causal and Sequential Relationships:** Introduce specific relationship types like `causes`, `leads_to`, `precedes`, `follows`, `motivates`,\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique that will be used to improve the graph construction prompt. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

For instance, \"attacks\" is useful, but a \"causes death of\" or \"motivates action\" relationship would be more direct for plot understanding.\n\n4.  **Ineffective Retrieval Strategy for Plot:** The retrieval plan doesn't guide the agent to look for narrative arcs. It should prioritize identifying:\n    *   **Protagonists/Antagonists:** Key figures driving the conflict.\n    *   **Central Conflicts:** The main struggles.\n    *   **Key Events:** Turning points, climaxes, resolutions.\n    *   **Causal Chains:** How one event leads to another.\n\n5.  **Absence of Temporal Information:** Plots unfold over time. The graph lacks any mechanism to represent the sequence of events, making it difficult to reconstruct a chronological narrative.\n\n**Recommendations for Graph Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Introduce Event Nodes:** Create dedicated node types for \"Event,\" \"Action,\" or \"PlotPoint.\" These nodes can link characters, locations, and objects involved in specific occurrences.\n2.  **Develop Causal and Sequential Relationships:** Introduce specific relationship types like `causes`, `leads_to`, `precedes`, `follows`, `motivates`,\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the chunk size can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

If a significant event or character interaction spans across a section of text that is split across multiple 200-token chunks, the LLM responsible for graph extraction from each chunk will receive incomplete context.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray volcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us. But of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by Luna's bulk, we know little. Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in diameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its meaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk, life that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval lake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the starry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth. In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called Noork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the trail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned girl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a sheathed dagger. Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine contours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the insignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration. Not forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged cliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest, and the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade,\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply. The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and make the Fatherland invincible.\" \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies? There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth.

New relationships were established to detail Karl Von Mark's motivations (conquering Earth, making the Fatherland invincible), his interactions and conflicts with Noork (suspecting pretense, threatening, attacking, calling names), and the actions of the Men from Wari (attacking Karl Von Mark and his men with arrows). The text also clarifies that Doctor Von Mark is indeed Karl Von Mark, and that Stephen Dietrich had previously pursued him.

Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph. Your goal is to refine and enhance the existing graph by:\n1. Adding new entities and relationships that are mentioned in the text but missing from the graph\n2. Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 133 nodes and 330 relationships.

Noork found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads vanished. These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like this.\" Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians lay.

A specific fallen 'Misty One' is also detailed, allowing for a more granular entity.

The text also clarifies Noork's initial superstitious 'hates' and subsequent realization ('perceives_as' initially, then 'hates' is overcome). The causal link of Noork 'kills' the specific fallen Misty One is crucial. The interactions of Noork 'interacts_with' and 'discovers_similarity_to' the fallen Misty One are detailed, along with comparisons and contrasts with Noork and men of 'Zuran'. The fallen Misty One is described as 'wears' a tunic and 'carries'/'wields' weapons, including knives and a club. Noork 'accuses' both the Misty Ones and the Temple of Uzdon based on his observations. His journey is further contextualized as he 'travels_towards' the Temple of the Skull. The origin of Noork's fear is clarified with the 'was_instilled_fear_by' relationship to the Vasads. Property updates were made to 'Noork' to reflect his new experiences and possessions, and to 'Misty Ones' to capture their evolving description and nature.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it. Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from shoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy. For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 133 nodes and 330 relationships.

In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him. As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop aside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed. \"Gurn!\" cried Noork. A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother. And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed. Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain Dietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil man when my bird died.\" He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The evil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace with you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\" \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.

Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the eye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of rock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for windows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at three distinct levels. Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple. Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another of their number. He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the jaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose rocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the central raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly worked metalâ€”gold, silver and brassâ€”vied with the faded garish colors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed two beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the wolf-headed shape a female. These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura worshippedâ€”mighty\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 133 nodes and 330 relationships.

Another slave was working in a nearby field, his crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not watching when Rold abruptly faded from view. Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of the vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had no wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens of the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the escape of the slaves. They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging as he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping from below, drew Sarna to his side.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrichâ€”whose memory was gone completelyâ€”again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end. The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm, numbing it so he felt nothing for some time. One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with, Noork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. Noork At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes.\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Relationships were added to detail Noork's intentions to travel to these locations, the Misty Ones' inhabitation of the island and their theft of the girl's friends, Noork's evasion of the girl's vanishing and subsequent attack by an unseen club, his climb into the trees, and his use of fruit as a weapon against the Misty Ones. Properties were updated for Noork to reflect his combat skills and for the girl to highlight her friends' capture.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 133 nodes and 330 relationships.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph. Your goal is to refine and enhance the existing graph by:\n1. Adding new entities and relationships that are mentioned in the text but missing from the graph\n2. Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text.

For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of the cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour the great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death of the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the words that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated them aloud. \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\" The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going back to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow and stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle giant. Noork grinned. \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her. \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you hunter or escaped slave?\" \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted narl last night when it attacked you.\" Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never far from the hilt of her hunting dagger. Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder of limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin. \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet you speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes opened yet wider. \"Who are you?\" \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the wild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for my friend.\" The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall and strong?

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

They rolled over and over down the shadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully. For a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction of the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then they jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to blood-slippery step. The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man with a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more. He sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a half-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps. In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging out, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle on the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion of the upper temple was muted to a murmur. So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that had dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to battle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm. He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two warriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous gurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes. Noork grinned. From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not snore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed to a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would not give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the room.\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Relationships were established to detail the sequence of events, interactions between characters, and the physical environment. For instance, 'Noork falls_down shadowy stair' captures the initial event, while 'Noork snaps_neck_of other man with a pistol-like report' details a crucial action. The relationship 'struggle on the stairs of stone audible_from_despite_muffled_sound upper temple' highlights the sensory information and the proximity of events. New events like 'snapped the neck' and 'striking' were also introduced to capture specific actions.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered.

Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white man's legs kept Noork away\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Properties of existing entities like 'Noork' and 'Priest' are updated to reflect their skills and equipment mentioned in the text. Specifically, 'Noork' is further described as a 'white man' and 'agile', while the 'Priest' is described with his specific attire and skills. The 'Prison Door' description is enhanced to include the 'Massive Timber' barring it. The relationship 'attacked' was refined to 'attacks' where Noork is the aggressor towards the door in his escape attempt.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two upper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty Ones climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to the slaves and common citizens of the island. As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two short swords rose to bar his way. \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere gruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the most beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the sacrifice is chosen.\" Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside. In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor sharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and shoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward impetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his left. His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony structure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his hands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning gurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon it, and his shortened\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Relationships are established between these new entities and existing ones, such as the mate relationship between Uzdon and Lornu, the coveting of slave women by temple guards, and the restriction of upper levels to priests and Misty Ones. Property updates are made to reflect Noork's status as a slave and add details about the temple guards' duties and the circumstances under which Noork's sword became dislodged.

Your goal is to generate a sequence of tool calls that effectively traverse a knowledge graph to gather information necessary to construct a comprehensive plot summary.\n\n**Core Principles for Retrieval Planning:**\n\n1.  **Strategic Exploration:**\n    *   Start broadly to identify key entities (characters, locations, significant objects) and potential plot-driving relationships.\n    *   Avoid getting stuck on a single entity. If an initial path yields limited results or becomes repetitive, broaden the search or pivot to other promising entities.\n    *   Prioritize exploring relationships that are indicative of plot progression (e.g., actions, conflicts, goals, motivations, cause-and-effect).\n\n2.  **Relationship-Centric Traversal:**\n    *   Do not solely rely on `get_neighbors`. Actively consider using relationship-specific retrieval functions (e.g., `get_relationships`, `get_nodes_by_relationship`) when appropriate.\n    *   When exploring neighbors, analyze the *types* of relationships connecting entities. These often contain crucial plot information.\n\n3.  **Iterative Refinement and Synthesis:**\n    *   Each retrieval step should build upon previous information. Explain your reasoning for the next step based on the gathered context.\n    *   Aim to synthesize retrieved information to identify key narrative threads, conflicts, and character arcs.\n    *   If a path is exhausted or yields no relevant information, adjust your strategy.\n\n4.  **Direct Information Seeking:**\n    *   If the query involves keywords like \"plot,\" \"story,\" \"summary,\" or similar, consider directly searching for nodes or relationships containing these terms early in the process.\n\n5.  **Function Usage Guidelines:**\n    *   `get_entities_by_type(entity_type: str)`: Use to find initial entities of a specific type (e.g., \"Person\", \"Location\", \"Event\").\n    *   `get_neighbors(entity_id: str, relationship_type: Optional[str] = None)`: Use to explore direct connections of an entity. Specify `relationship_type` if you have a hypothesis about the connection.\n    *   `get_entity_by_name(name: str)`: Use when you have a specific entity name from previous results or the query.\n    *   `get_relationships(entity", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 350 nodes and 678 relationships.

Your goal is to generate a sequence of tool calls that effectively traverse a knowledge graph to gather information necessary to construct a comprehensive plot summary.\n\n**Core Principles for Retrieval Planning:**\n\n1.  **Strategic Exploration:**\n    *   Start broadly to identify key entities (characters, locations, significant objects) and potential plot-driving relationships.\n    *   Avoid getting stuck on a single entity. If an initial path yields limited results or becomes repetitive, broaden the search or pivot to other promising entities.\n    *   Prioritize exploring relationships that are indicative of plot progression (e.g., actions, conflicts, goals, motivations, cause-and-effect).\n\n2.  **Relationship-Centric Traversal:**\n    *   Do not solely rely on `get_neighbors`. Actively consider using relationship-specific retrieval functions (e.g., `get_relationships`, `get_nodes_by_relationship`) when appropriate.\n    *   When exploring neighbors, analyze the *types* of relationships connecting entities. These often contain crucial plot information.\n\n3.  **Iterative Refinement and Synthesis:**\n    *   Each retrieval step should build upon previous information. Explain your reasoning for the next step based on the gathered context.\n    *   Aim to synthesize retrieved information to identify key narrative threads, conflicts, and character arcs.\n    *   If a path is exhausted or yields no relevant information, adjust your strategy.\n\n4.  **Direct Information Seeking:**\n    *   If the query involves keywords like \"plot,\" \"story,\" \"summary,\" or similar, consider directly searching for nodes or relationships containing these terms early in the process.\n\n5.  **Function Usage Guidelines:**\n    *   `get_entities_by_type(entity_type: str)`: Use to find initial entities of a specific type (e.g., \"Person\", \"Location\", \"Event\").\n    *   `get_neighbors(entity_id: str, relationship_type: Optional[str] = None)`: Use to explore direct connections of an entity. Specify `relationship_type` if you have a hypothesis about the connection.\n    *   `get_entity_by_name(name: str)`: Use when you have a specific entity name from previous results or the query.\n    *   `get_relationships(entity", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 350 nodes and 678 relationships.

Your goal is to generate a sequence of tool calls that effectively traverse a knowledge graph to gather information necessary to construct a comprehensive plot summary.\n\n**Core Principles for Retrieval Planning:**\n\n1.  **Strategic Exploration:**\n    *   Start broadly to identify key entities (characters, locations, significant objects) and potential plot-driving relationships.\n    *   Avoid getting stuck on a single entity. If an initial path yields limited results or becomes repetitive, broaden the search or pivot to other promising entities.\n    *   Prioritize exploring relationships that are indicative of plot progression (e.g., actions, conflicts, goals, motivations, cause-and-effect).\n\n2.  **Relationship-Centric Traversal:**\n    *   Do not solely rely on `get_neighbors`. Actively consider using relationship-specific retrieval functions (e.g., `get_relationships`, `get_nodes_by_relationship`) when appropriate.\n    *   When exploring neighbors, analyze the *types* of relationships connecting entities. These often contain crucial plot information.\n\n3.  **Iterative Refinement and Synthesis:**\n    *   Each retrieval step should build upon previous information. Explain your reasoning for the next step based on the gathered context.\n    *   Aim to synthesize retrieved information to identify key narrative threads, conflicts, and character arcs.\n    *   If a path is exhausted or yields no relevant information, adjust your strategy.\n\n4.  **Direct Information Seeking:**\n    *   If the query involves keywords like \"plot,\" \"story,\" \"summary,\" or similar, consider directly searching for nodes or relationships containing these terms early in the process.\n\n5.  **Function Usage Guidelines:**\n    *   `get_entities_by_type(entity_type: str)`: Use to find initial entities of a specific type (e.g., \"Person\", \"Location\", \"Event\").\n    *   `get_neighbors(entity_id: str, relationship_type: Optional[str] = None)`: Use to explore direct connections of an entity. Specify `relationship_type` if you have a hypothesis about the connection.\n    *   `get_entity_by_name(name: str)`: Use when you have a specific entity name from previous results or the query.\n    *   `get_relationships(entity", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 350 nodes and 678 relationships.

Your goal is to generate a sequence of tool calls that effectively traverse a knowledge graph to gather information necessary to construct a comprehensive plot summary.\n\n**Core Principles for Retrieval Planning:**\n\n1.  **Strategic Exploration:**\n    *   Start broadly to identify key entities (characters, locations, significant objects) and potential plot-driving relationships.\n    *   Avoid getting stuck on a single entity. If an initial path yields limited results or becomes repetitive, broaden the search or pivot to other promising entities.\n    *   Prioritize exploring relationships that are indicative of plot progression (e.g., actions, conflicts, goals, motivations, cause-and-effect).\n\n2.  **Relationship-Centric Traversal:**\n    *   Do not solely rely on `get_neighbors`. Actively consider using relationship-specific retrieval functions (e.g., `get_relationships`, `get_nodes_by_relationship`) when appropriate.\n    *   When exploring neighbors, analyze the *types* of relationships connecting entities. These often contain crucial plot information.\n\n3.  **Iterative Refinement and Synthesis:**\n    *   Each retrieval step should build upon previous information. Explain your reasoning for the next step based on the gathered context.\n    *   Aim to synthesize retrieved information to identify key narrative threads, conflicts, and character arcs.\n    *   If a path is exhausted or yields no relevant information, adjust your strategy.\n\n4.  **Direct Information Seeking:**\n    *   If the query involves keywords like \"plot,\" \"story,\" \"summary,\" or similar, consider directly searching for nodes or relationships containing these terms early in the process.\n\n5.  **Function Usage Guidelines:**\n    *   `get_entities_by_type(entity_type: str)`: Use to find initial entities of a specific type (e.g., \"Person\", \"Location\", \"Event\").\n    *   `get_neighbors(entity_id: str, relationship_type: Optional[str] = None)`: Use to explore direct connections of an entity. Specify `relationship_type` if you have a hypothesis about the connection.\n    *   `get_entity_by_name(name: str)`: Use when you have a specific entity name from previous results or the query.\n    *   `get_relationships(entity", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 350 nodes and 678 relationships.

This suggests that the documents being processed or the graph extraction process itself is not yielding any meaningful information related to narrative content.\n2.  **Lack of Information:** An \"empty graph\" by definition contains no nodes or edges, meaning there is no data to analyze or extract from. This makes it impossible for any subsequent LLM agent to derive any answer, let alone one about a story's plot.\n3.  **Repetitive Failure:** The fact that this outcome repeats across multiple iterations (Iteration 1 to 6) strongly suggests a systemic problem, not a transient one.

The repeated retrieval of an \"empty graph\" indicates a deeper problem with the underlying graph construction or the initial data.\n\nHere's a critique and suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Critique of the Retrieval Plan:**\n\n1.  **Over-reliance on Specific Keywords:** The plan rigidly targets the word \"plot.\" Stories often describe their plots implicitly through character actions, events, and dialogue, rather than explicitly stating \"plot.\" This keyword-centric approach will fail if the graph nodes don't directly label plot elements as such.\n2.  **Ignoring Graph Structure:** The plan doesn't leverage the potential richness of graph structures. Instead of exploring relationships, central nodes, or communities that *represent* plot elements, it only looks for a literal keyword.\n3.  **Premature Search Strategy:** The plan seems to initiate a search for \"plot\" immediately, without first establishing *any* context or understanding of the available nodes and their types. This is inefficient if the graph is large or complex.\n4.  **Failure to Adapt:** The consistent \"empty graph\" output should trigger a re-evaluation of the entire process, not just a repetition of the same search strategy. The plan does not adapt to the fact that the initial retrieval is failing.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Broaden Initial Exploration:** Instead of searching for \"plot,\" the initial move should involve a more general exploration of the graph to understand its contents. This could include:\n    *   **Identifying Node Types:** Discovering the different categories of nodes present (e.g., characters, locations, events, themes).\n    *   **Finding Central Nodes:** Identifying the most connected or important nodes, as these are likely to be key elements of the story.\n    *   **Exploring Neighboring Nodes:** Starting from a prominent node and examining its direct connections to understand context.\n2.  **Inferential Search for Plot:** Once a basic understanding of the graph is established, the search for plot elements should become inferential. This means looking for nodes and relationships that *collectively* describe the story's progression:\n    *   **Sequence of Events:** Identifying nodes representing actions or occurrences and their temporal relationships.\n    *   **Character Arcs:** Tracking character nodes and their interactions, motivations, and changes", "system_prompt_length": 5407, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 2589, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 5248, "enhanced_prompt_length": 5407, "response_length": 2589}}

To start gathering information relevant to the plot, I should search for nodes that might directly contain information about the plot. Searching for the keyword 'plot' is the most direct way to find such nodes.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nThe retrieval plan, which consistently searches for nodes containing the keyword \"plot,\" is fundamentally flawed because it assumes the graph will directly contain this keyword in a way that's easily discoverable. The repeated retrieval of an \"empty graph\" indicates a deeper problem with the underlying graph construction or the initial data.\n\nHere's a critique and suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Critique of the Retrieval Plan:**\n\n1.  **Over-reliance on Specific Keywords:** The plan rigidly targets the word \"plot.\" Stories often describe their plots implicitly through character actions, events, and dialogue, rather than explicitly stating \"plot.\" This keyword-centric approach will fail if the graph nodes don't directly label plot elements as such.\n2.  **Ignoring Graph Structure:** The plan doesn't leverage the potential richness of graph structures. Instead of exploring relationships, central nodes, or communities that *represent* plot elements, it only looks for a literal keyword.\n3.  **Premature Search Strategy:** The plan seems to initiate a search for \"plot\" immediately, without first establishing *any* context or understanding of the available nodes and their types. This is inefficient if the graph is large or complex.\n4.  **Failure to Adapt:** The consistent \"empty graph\" output should trigger a re-evaluation of the entire process, not just a repetition of the same search strategy. The plan does not adapt to the fact that the initial retrieval is failing.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Broaden Initial Exploration:** Instead of searching for \"plot,\" the initial move should involve a more general exploration of the graph to understand its contents. This could include:\n    *   **Identifying Node Types:** Discovering the different categories of nodes present (e.g., characters, locations, events, themes).\n    *   **Finding Central Nodes:** Identifying the most connected or important nodes, as these are likely to be key elements of the story.\n    *   **Exploring Neighboring Nodes:** Starting from a prominent node and examining its direct connections to understand context.\n2.  **Inferential Search for Plot:** Once a basic understanding of the graph is established, the search for plot elements should become inferential. This means looking for nodes and relationships that *collectively* describe the story's progression:\n    *   **Sequence of Events:** Identifying nodes representing actions or occurrences and their temporal relationships.\n    *   **Character Arcs:** Tracking character nodes and their interactions, motivations, and changes\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique that will be used to improve the retrieval planning prompt.  \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

Your primary goal is to understand and extract narrative information, including the plot, characters, settings, and events.\n\n**Your Retrieval Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Narrative Context:** Before directly searching for specific plot points, aim to grasp the story's core elements.\n2.  **Identify Key Entities and Node Types:** Explore the graph to identify prominent node types (e.g., Person, Event, Location, Object) and the most central or frequently connected nodes within these types. This provides a foundation for understanding the story's components.\n3.  **Explore Relationships:** Analyze the relationships *between* identified entities. The plot is often revealed through sequences of events, character interactions, causal links, and thematic connections. Focus on relationships that indicate actions, motivations, or consequences (e.g., `PARTICIPATED_IN`, `CAUSED`, `TRAVELS_TO`, `INTERACTS_WITH`, `RELATES_TO`).\n4.  **Inferential and Pattern-Based Retrieval:** Do not rely on a single, literal keyword like \"plot.\" Instead, infer plot progression by piecing together connected events, character journeys, and the evolution of their states or relationships. Look for temporal sequences and causal chains.\n5.  **Adaptive Exploration:** If an initial exploration yields limited results, do not simply repeat the same query.

The most common entity type is \"\" with 133 instances. The most frequent relationship type is \"wears\" with 12 occurrences.\nRetrieval Plan: The user is asking for the 'plot of the story'. To start gathering information about the plot, I should first search for any nodes that explicitly contain the keyword 'plot'.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nThe retrieval plan, which consistently searches for nodes containing the keyword \"plot,\" is fundamentally flawed because it assumes the graph will directly contain this keyword in a way that's easily discoverable. The repeated retrieval of an \"empty graph\" indicates a deeper problem with the underlying graph construction or the initial data.\n\nHere's a critique and suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Critique of the Retrieval Plan:**\n\n1.  **Over-reliance on Specific Keywords:** The plan rigidly targets the word \"plot.\" Stories often describe their plots implicitly through character actions, events, and dialogue, rather than explicitly stating \"plot.\" This keyword-centric approach will fail if the graph nodes don't directly label plot elements as such.\n2.  **Ignoring Graph Structure:** The plan doesn't leverage the potential richness of graph structures. Instead of exploring relationships, central nodes, or communities that *represent* plot elements, it only looks for a literal keyword.\n3.  **Premature Search Strategy:** The plan seems to initiate a search for \"plot\" immediately, without first establishing *any* context or understanding of the available nodes and their types. This is inefficient if the graph is large or complex.\n4.  **Failure to Adapt:** The consistent \"empty graph\" output should trigger a re-evaluation of the entire process, not just a repetition of the same search strategy. The plan does not adapt to the fact that the initial retrieval is failing.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Broaden Initial Exploration:** Instead of searching for \"plot,\" the initial move should involve a more general exploration of the graph to understand its contents. This could include:\n    *   **Identifying Node Types:** Discovering the different categories of nodes present (e.g., characters, locations, events, themes).\n    *   **Finding Central Nodes:** Identifying the most connected or important nodes, as these are likely to be key elements of the story.\n    *   **Exploring Neighboring Nodes:** Starting from a prominent node and examining its direct connections to understand context.\n2.  **Inferential Search for Plot:** Once a basic understanding of the graph is established, the search for plot elements should become inferential. This means looking for nodes and relationships that *collectively* describe the story's progression:\n    *   **Sequence of Events:** Identifying nodes representing actions or occurrences and their temporal relationships.\n    *   **Character Arcs:** Tracking character nodes and their interactions, motivations, and changes\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the graph can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing. Focus on the most critical points and be concise.", "user_prompt": "Please provide your critique and feedback.", "llm_response": "The graph construction and subsequent retrieval plan exhibit several critical weaknesses that hinder effective plot extraction.\n\n**Critique of Graph Construction:**\n\n1.  **Overwhelming Specificity, Lack of Thematic Cohesion:** The graph is populated with an immense number of highly specific relationship types (e.g., \"observes noork wearing,\" \"audible from despite muffled sound,\" \"asks about arrival via\"). While granular detail can be useful, this proliferation of niche relationships suggests a lack of higher-level abstraction or categorization. It's difficult to discern overarching plot drivers or thematic connections when faced with such a granular and potentially noisy set of relations.\n2.  **Node Type Imbalance and Ambiguity:** The dominance of the generic `\"\"` node type (133 instances) is problematic. Without clear labels or further categorization, these nodes are essentially uninterpretable. This imbalance suggests that core narrative elements are not being properly identified or categorized into meaningful types like \"Character,\" \"Event,\" or \"Conflict.\" The high number of \"Location\" and \"Person\" nodes is expected, but their utility is diminished by the lack of structured relationships connecting them to plot progression.\n3.  **Inconsistent Relationship Naming and Redundancy:** There are numerous instances of redundant or very similarly named relationships (e.g., \"associated with\" appears multiple times with varying counts, \"travels towards\" appears twice with different counts, \"attack\" vs. \"attacks\"). This inconsistency makes robust querying difficult and suggests a potential lack of standardization in the graph generation process.\n\n**Critique of Retrieval Plan:**\n\n1.  **Flawed Keyword Dependency:** The retrieval plan's sole reliance on the literal keyword \"plot\" is a fundamental flaw. Story plots are rarely explicitly labeled as \"plot\" in knowledge graphs. Instead, plot is inferred from sequences of events, character motivations, and causal relationships. This approach is brittle and will consistently fail to retrieve relevant information if such explicit labeling is absent, as indicated by the repeated \"empty graph\" output.\n2.  **Failure to Leverage Graph Structure:** The plan completely ignores the rich graph structure. It doesn't attempt to identify central nodes, explore common relationships, or leverage community detection, all of which are provided as available functions and are crucial for understanding narrative flow and key plot points.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Standardize and Abstract Relationship Types:** Consolidate highly specific relationship types into more general, meaningful categories (e.g., \"interacts", "system_prompt_length": 20156, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 2690, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 19997, "enhanced_prompt_length": 20156, "response_length": 2690}}

The most common entity type is \"\" with 133 instances. The most frequent relationship type is \"wears\" with 12 occurrences.\n\nThe critique on the graph was: \nThe graph construction and subsequent retrieval plan exhibit several critical weaknesses that hinder effective plot extraction.\n\n**Critique of Graph Construction:**\n\n1.  **Overwhelming Specificity, Lack of Thematic Cohesion:** The graph is populated with an immense number of highly specific relationship types (e.g., \"observes noork wearing,\" \"audible from despite muffled sound,\" \"asks about arrival via\"). While granular detail can be useful, this proliferation of niche relationships suggests a lack of higher-level abstraction or categorization. It's difficult to discern overarching plot drivers or thematic connections when faced with such a granular and potentially noisy set of relations.\n2.  **Node Type Imbalance and Ambiguity:** The dominance of the generic `\"\"` node type (133 instances) is problematic. Without clear labels or further categorization, these nodes are essentially uninterpretable. This imbalance suggests that core narrative elements are not being properly identified or categorized into meaningful types like \"Character,\" \"Event,\" or \"Conflict.\" The high number of \"Location\" and \"Person\" nodes is expected, but their utility is diminished by the lack of structured relationships connecting them to plot progression.\n3.  **Inconsistent Relationship Naming and Redundancy:** There are numerous instances of redundant or very similarly named relationships (e.g., \"associated with\" appears multiple times with varying counts, \"travels towards\" appears twice with different counts, \"attack\" vs. \"attacks\"). This inconsistency makes robust querying difficult and suggests a potential lack of standardization in the graph generation process.\n\n**Critique of Retrieval Plan:**\n\n1.  **Flawed Keyword Dependency:** The retrieval plan's sole reliance on the literal keyword \"plot\" is a fundamental flaw. Story plots are rarely explicitly labeled as \"plot\" in knowledge graphs. Instead, plot is inferred from sequences of events, character motivations, and causal relationships. This approach is brittle and will consistently fail to retrieve relevant information if such explicit labeling is absent, as indicated by the repeated \"empty graph\" output.\n2.  **Failure to Leverage Graph Structure:** The plan completely ignores the rich graph structure. It doesn't attempt to identify central nodes, explore common relationships, or leverage community detection, all of which are provided as available functions and are crucial for understanding narrative flow and key plot points.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Standardize and Abstract Relationship Types:** Consolidate highly specific relationship types into more general, meaningful categories (e.g., \"interacts\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique that will be used to improve the graph construction prompt. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

The prompt needs to enforce a more rigorous and consistent entity typing strategy.\n\n2.  **Proliferation of Overly Specific Relationships:** The prompt encourages adding \"new entities and relationships\" without sufficient guidance on the *granularity* or *abstraction level* of these relationships. This results in a vast number of highly specific relationships (e.g., \"observes noork wearing,\" \"audible from despite muffled sound\"). While some detail is good, this leads to a \"noisy\" graph where overarching narrative connections are obscured. The prompt should encourage the extraction of more general, higher-level relationships that capture plot drivers and thematic links.\n\n3.  **Lack of Prioritization and Redundancy:** The prompt asks to \"add new entities and relationships\" and \"update or enrich existing entity properties\" but doesn't sufficiently emphasize *avoiding redundancy* or *prioritizing information that adds significant value*. The graph summary shows numerous similar or identical relationship types with different counts (e.g., \"associated with,\" \"travels towards,\" \"attack\"). The prompt needs to explicitly instruct the LLM to identify and merge redundant information or prioritize unique and impactful additions.\n\n4.  **Insufficient Guidance on Property Extraction:** The prompt requests properties for new entities but lacks specific instructions on *what kind of properties are most valuable for downstream tasks* (like plot understanding).

The most frequent relationship type is \"wears\" with 12 occurrences.\n\nThe critique on the graph was:\nThe graph construction and subsequent retrieval plan exhibit several critical weaknesses that hinder effective plot extraction.\n\n**Critique of Graph Construction:**\n\n1.  **Overwhelming Specificity, Lack of Thematic Cohesion:** The graph is populated with an immense number of highly specific relationship types (e.g., \"observes noork wearing,\" \"audible from despite muffled sound,\" \"asks about arrival via\"). While granular detail can be useful, this proliferation of niche relationships suggests a lack of higher-level abstraction or categorization. It's difficult to discern overarching plot drivers or thematic connections when faced with such a granular and potentially noisy set of relations.\n2.  **Node Type Imbalance and Ambiguity:** The dominance of the generic `\"\"` node type (133 instances) is problematic. Without clear labels or further categorization, these nodes are essentially uninterpretable. This imbalance suggests that core narrative elements are not being properly identified or categorized into meaningful types like \"Character,\" \"Event,\" or \"Conflict.\" The high number of \"Location\" and \"Person\" nodes is expected, but their utility is diminished by the lack of structured relationships connecting them to plot progression.\n3.  **Inconsistent Relationship Naming and Redundancy:** There are numerous instances of redundant or very similarly named relationships (e.g., \"associated with\" appears multiple times with varying counts, \"travels towards\" appears twice with different counts, \"attack\" vs. \"attacks\"). This inconsistency makes robust querying difficult and suggests a potential lack of standardization in the graph generation process.\n\n**Critique of Retrieval Plan:**\n\n1.  **Flawed Keyword Dependency:** The retrieval plan's sole reliance on the literal keyword \"plot\" is a fundamental flaw. Story plots are rarely explicitly labeled as \"plot\" in knowledge graphs. Instead, plot is inferred from sequences of events, character motivations, and causal relationships. This approach is brittle and will consistently fail to retrieve relevant information if such explicit labeling is absent, as indicated by the repeated \"empty graph\" output.\n2.  **Failure to Leverage Graph Structure:** The plan completely ignores the rich graph structure. It doesn't attempt to identify central nodes, explore common relationships, or leverage community detection, all of which are provided as available functions and are crucial for understanding narrative flow and key plot points.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Standardize and Abstract Relationship Types:** Consolidate highly specific relationship types into more general, meaningful categories (e.g., \"interacts\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique of how the chunk size can be improved. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

Here's a critique focusing on how this chunk size might be improved:\n\n**Critique of Chunk Size (300):**\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Granularity Leading to Over-Specificity:** A chunk size of 300 tokens is neither small enough to focus on single events or character interactions, nor large enough to capture broader narrative arcs. This \"in-between\" size likely results in chunks that contain a mix of distinct, yet often unrelated, narrative elements. For instance, a single 300-token chunk could contain a character's internal monologue, a description of a location, and the beginning of a dialogue, all of which might be fragmented across relationships within the graph. This contributes directly to the \"overwhelming specificity\" and \"lack of thematic cohesion\" observed in the graph's relationship types.\n\n2.  **Difficulty in Capturing Meaningful Entities and Relationships:** When a chunk is too large, it can dilute the significance of individual entities and their direct relationships. Conversely, if a chunk is too small, it might not contain enough context to establish meaningful connections. A 300-token chunk might be too large to isolate specific character actions or motivations effectively, leading to weaker or more ambiguous relationships being extracted. This could explain the imbalance in node types, where generic `\"\"` nodes dominate, suggesting that the LLM struggled to identify and categorize specific, plot-relevant entities within each chunk.\n\n3.  **Impact on Relationship Redundancy and Inconsistency:** The current chunk size may lead to the same event or interaction being described differently across multiple chunks, especially if the narrative flows across chunk boundaries. When these slightly different descriptions are processed by the LLM for graph extraction, it can result in redundant or inconsistently named relationships (e.g., variations of \"associated with\" or \"travels towards\").

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

One corner of the cavern was walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and toward this Noork made his way.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 217 nodes and 348 relationships.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 217 nodes and 348 relationships.

So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that had dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to battle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm. He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two warriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous gurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes. Noork grinned. From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not snore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed to a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would not give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the room.\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph. Your goal is to refine and enhance the existing graph by:\n1. Adding new entities and relationships that are mentioned in the text but missing from the graph\n2. Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 217 nodes and 348 relationships.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text.

The text also shows Noork fighting back against the Misty Ones before being overcome and explicitly states that Noork is the one being trapped.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

several new entities crucial to the narrative progression. 'Captain Dietrich' is introduced as a central character with alias 'Noork', origin 'America', and profession 'Hunter', directly linked to the events. 'America' is established as his origin location. 'Tholon Sarna' is identified as a character and Sarna's brother, interacting with Dietrich. 'Misty Ones' are introduced as a group with a specific visibility attribute related to 'Uzdon'. 'Uzdon' is identified as a location with a trapping characteristic. The 'vision shield' is noted as an object picked up by Dietrich. New relationships capture key plot points: Dietrich's identity and alias, his communication with Gurn and Tholon Sarna, his origin from America, his past action of hunting and killing an 'evil man', his possession of a bird that died, his physical interaction (embracing) with Sarna, his desire to live and find peace with Gurn and Sarna, Tholon Sarna's address to Dietrich (Noork) and approval, the visibility of Misty Ones in Uzdon, Uzdon's potential to trap Dietrich, Dietrich picking up the vision shield, Sarna's familial relationship to Tholon Sarna, Dietrich's perception of Misty Ones visibility, his confirmation of the evil man's death, and the safety of his home valley 'America'. Additionally, properties were updated for Gurn and Sarna to reflect their sibling relationship mentioned in the context of Dietrich wanting to live with them and their sister.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 2093, "user_prompt_length": 11193, "response_length": 11872, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 638, "existing_graph_summary_length": 9202, "mode": "refinement"}}

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man with a pistol-like report.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 217 nodes and 348 relationships.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Crucially, the relationship between the 'character' and these new entities, as well as existing entities like 'Rold' and the 'alarm', are detailed. For example, the act of wearing specific items, explaining conditions, escaping, and toiling in fields are all new actions and states described. The entity 'character' is updated to reflect the new information that he is also referred to as 'Noork' and his specific actions during the escape. Rold's description is also updated to include his activity and disappearance. The 'hood' and 'violet eyes' are further described based on their context in the text. The 'alarm' is now explicitly stated as something to escape before. The 'transparent mask' is linked to 'Uzdon's window' as per the text's description. Relationships detail the sequence of actions: donning masks and robes, explaining damage, taking hands, planning escape, reaching fields, and specific actions within those fields involving slaves, plows, and animals (Vasads). The text also introduces 'Noork' as the character and details his sweating and movement towards his 'rope' in a 'field'.\"\n}", "system_prompt_length": 2093, "user_prompt_length": 11397, "response_length": 15484, "metadata": {"chunk_length": 842, "existing_graph_summary_length": 9202, "mode": "refinement"}}

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph. Your goal is to refine and enhance the existing graph by:\n1. Adding new entities and relationships that are mentioned in the text but missing from the graph\n2. Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 217 nodes and 348 relationships.

Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph. Your goal is to refine and enhance the existing graph by:\n1. Adding new entities and relationships that are mentioned in the text but missing from the graph\n2. Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 217 nodes and 348 relationships.

The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end. The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two upper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty Ones climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to the slaves and common citizens of the island. As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two short swords rose to bar his way. \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere gruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

The text also details restrictions on slaves and common citizens regarding the upper levels, the function of the swords in blocking passage, and the communication from a voice about the rules set by the High Priest.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph. Your goal is to refine and enhance the existing graph by:\n1. Adding new entities and relationships that are mentioned in the text but missing from the graph\n2. Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 217 nodes and 348 relationships.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb. Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather\n\nFocus on finding new information not already captured in the existing graph.

Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

The relationships capture the narrative flow: cloaks on wall, visibility in light, Noork shedding and donning clothes, concealing items, moving bodies, hiding them, and descending towards the prison pit where Tholon Sarna is held.

Your task is to extract a knowledge graph that accurately represents the narrative structure and plot progression of a given text. Focus on identifying key narrative elements and their relationships to reconstruct the plot's sequence and causality.\n\n**Graph Construction Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Node Types:**\n    *   **Entity:** Represents characters (Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character), significant objects, locations, or abstract concepts crucial to the plot. Assign a `type` attribute (e.g., `type: \"Character\"`, `type: \"Object\"`, `type: \"Location\"`).\n    *   **Event:** Represents a significant action or occurrence in the narrative. Assign `type: \"Event\"`. Event nodes should encapsulate the action, participants, and outcomes.\n\n2.  **Relationship Types:** Use specific, descriptive relationships to capture narrative dynamics:\n    *   **Interaction:** `interacts_with`, `helps`, `hinders`, `conflicts_with`, `loves`, `hates`, `communicates_with`.\n    *   **Causality:** `causes`, `leads_to`, `motivates`, `enables`, `prevents`.\n    *   **Temporal/Sequential:** `precedes`, `follows`, `occurs_during`.\n    *   **Possession/Association:** `possesses`, `is_at`, `related_to` (use sparingly for non-causal/temporal links).\n    *   **Event Participation:** `involves_character`, `involves_object`, `occurs_at`.\n\n3.  **Property Extraction:**\n    *   For **Entity** nodes, extract narrative-relevant properties like `description`, `motivation`, `key_trait`.\n    *   For **Event** nodes, extract properties such as `action_description`, `outcome`, `time_reference` (if explicit).\n\n4.  **Narrative Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize entities and events that directly drive the plot forward. Differentiate between main plot elements and background details.\n    *   Focus on extracting the *sequence* of events and the causal links between them.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nRepresent the graph as a list of JSON objects, where each object is either a node or a relationship.\n\n*   **Node Object:** `{\"id\": \"unique_id\", \"type\": \"NodeType", "user_prompt": "\nYou will be given a text and an existing knowledge graph.

Adding new properties to existing entities based on information in the text\n3. Creating new relationships between existing entities that were previously unconnected\n4. Updating or enriching existing entity properties with additional information from the text\n\nFor each new entity, you will include:\n- name: the entity name\n- type: the entity type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept)\n- properties: a list of key-value pairs describing characteristics of the entity extracted from the text. Each property should have a \"key\" and \"value\" field.\n\nFor each new relationship, you will include its type, a description, and the evidence from the text that supports this.\nThe relationships must be among the entities (both existing and new).\nProvide a list of triplets for new relationships in your answer.\n\nExisting Graph Summary:\nThis graph contains 217 nodes and 348 relationships.

Your primary goal is to understand and extract narrative information, including the plot, characters, settings, and events.\n\n**Your Retrieval Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Narrative Context:** Before directly searching for specific plot points, aim to grasp the story's core elements.\n2.  **Identify Key Entities and Node Types:** Explore the graph to identify prominent node types (e.g., Person, Event, Location, Object) and the most central or frequently connected nodes within these types. This provides a foundation for understanding the story's components.\n3.  **Explore Relationships:** Analyze the relationships *between* identified entities. The plot is often revealed through sequences of events, character interactions, causal links, and thematic connections. Focus on relationships that indicate actions, motivations, or consequences (e.g., `PARTICIPATED_IN`, `CAUSED`, `TRAVELS_TO`, `INTERACTS_WITH`, `RELATES_TO`).\n4.  **Inferential and Pattern-Based Retrieval:** Do not rely on a single, literal keyword like \"plot.\" Instead, infer plot progression by piecing together connected events, character journeys, and the evolution of their states or relationships. Look for temporal sequences and causal chains.\n5.  **Adaptive Exploration:** If an initial exploration yields limited results, do not simply repeat the same query. Adapt your strategy by broadening your search for entities, exploring different relationship types, or focusing on different aspects of the narrative (e.g., character motivations, setting changes).\n6.  **Information Synthesis:** Once relevant nodes and relationships are retrieved, synthesize the information to construct a coherent answer that addresses the user's query.\n\n**Function Usage:**\n\n*   Use `graph.find_nodes(query)` to discover nodes based on keywords, node types, or properties.\n*   Use `graph.get_neighbors(node_id, relationship_type)` to explore connections from a specific node.\n*   Use `graph.get_node_details(node_id)` to retrieve attributes of a node.\n*   Prefer broader searches initially (e.g., searching for common entity types or central nodes) before diving into specific details.\n*   Avoid overly specific or literal keyword searches that might miss indirectly represented information.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nIf a user asks \"What is the plot of the story?\", do", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 510 nodes and 907 relationships.

Your primary goal is to understand and extract narrative information, including the plot, characters, settings, and events.\n\n**Your Retrieval Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Narrative Context:** Before directly searching for specific plot points, aim to grasp the story's core elements.\n2.  **Identify Key Entities and Node Types:** Explore the graph to identify prominent node types (e.g., Person, Event, Location, Object) and the most central or frequently connected nodes within these types. This provides a foundation for understanding the story's components.\n3.  **Explore Relationships:** Analyze the relationships *between* identified entities. The plot is often revealed through sequences of events, character interactions, causal links, and thematic connections. Focus on relationships that indicate actions, motivations, or consequences (e.g., `PARTICIPATED_IN`, `CAUSED`, `TRAVELS_TO`, `INTERACTS_WITH`, `RELATES_TO`).\n4.  **Inferential and Pattern-Based Retrieval:** Do not rely on a single, literal keyword like \"plot.\" Instead, infer plot progression by piecing together connected events, character journeys, and the evolution of their states or relationships. Look for temporal sequences and causal chains.\n5.  **Adaptive Exploration:** If an initial exploration yields limited results, do not simply repeat the same query. Adapt your strategy by broadening your search for entities, exploring different relationship types, or focusing on different aspects of the narrative (e.g., character motivations, setting changes).\n6.  **Information Synthesis:** Once relevant nodes and relationships are retrieved, synthesize the information to construct a coherent answer that addresses the user's query.\n\n**Function Usage:**\n\n*   Use `graph.find_nodes(query)` to discover nodes based on keywords, node types, or properties.\n*   Use `graph.get_neighbors(node_id, relationship_type)` to explore connections from a specific node.\n*   Use `graph.get_node_details(node_id)` to retrieve attributes of a node.\n*   Prefer broader searches initially (e.g., searching for common entity types or central nodes) before diving into specific details.\n*   Avoid overly specific or literal keyword searches that might miss indirectly represented information.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nIf a user asks \"What is the plot of the story?\", do", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 510 nodes and 907 relationships.

Your primary goal is to understand and extract narrative information, including the plot, characters, settings, and events.\n\n**Your Retrieval Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Narrative Context:** Before directly searching for specific plot points, aim to grasp the story's core elements.\n2.  **Identify Key Entities and Node Types:** Explore the graph to identify prominent node types (e.g., Person, Event, Location, Object) and the most central or frequently connected nodes within these types. This provides a foundation for understanding the story's components.\n3.  **Explore Relationships:** Analyze the relationships *between* identified entities. The plot is often revealed through sequences of events, character interactions, causal links, and thematic connections. Focus on relationships that indicate actions, motivations, or consequences (e.g., `PARTICIPATED_IN`, `CAUSED`, `TRAVELS_TO`, `INTERACTS_WITH`, `RELATES_TO`).\n4.  **Inferential and Pattern-Based Retrieval:** Do not rely on a single, literal keyword like \"plot.\" Instead, infer plot progression by piecing together connected events, character journeys, and the evolution of their states or relationships. Look for temporal sequences and causal chains.\n5.  **Adaptive Exploration:** If an initial exploration yields limited results, do not simply repeat the same query. Adapt your strategy by broadening your search for entities, exploring different relationship types, or focusing on different aspects of the narrative (e.g., character motivations, setting changes).\n6.  **Information Synthesis:** Once relevant nodes and relationships are retrieved, synthesize the information to construct a coherent answer that addresses the user's query.\n\n**Function Usage:**\n\n*   Use `graph.find_nodes(query)` to discover nodes based on keywords, node types, or properties.\n*   Use `graph.get_neighbors(node_id, relationship_type)` to explore connections from a specific node.\n*   Use `graph.get_node_details(node_id)` to retrieve attributes of a node.\n*   Prefer broader searches initially (e.g., searching for common entity types or central nodes) before diving into specific details.\n*   Avoid overly specific or literal keyword searches that might miss indirectly represented information.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nIf a user asks \"What is the plot of the story?\", do", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 510 nodes and 907 relationships.

Your primary goal is to understand and extract narrative information, including the plot, characters, settings, and events.\n\n**Your Retrieval Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Narrative Context:** Before directly searching for specific plot points, aim to grasp the story's core elements.\n2.  **Identify Key Entities and Node Types:** Explore the graph to identify prominent node types (e.g., Person, Event, Location, Object) and the most central or frequently connected nodes within these types. This provides a foundation for understanding the story's components.\n3.  **Explore Relationships:** Analyze the relationships *between* identified entities. The plot is often revealed through sequences of events, character interactions, causal links, and thematic connections. Focus on relationships that indicate actions, motivations, or consequences (e.g., `PARTICIPATED_IN`, `CAUSED`, `TRAVELS_TO`, `INTERACTS_WITH`, `RELATES_TO`).\n4.  **Inferential and Pattern-Based Retrieval:** Do not rely on a single, literal keyword like \"plot.\" Instead, infer plot progression by piecing together connected events, character journeys, and the evolution of their states or relationships. Look for temporal sequences and causal chains.\n5.  **Adaptive Exploration:** If an initial exploration yields limited results, do not simply repeat the same query. Adapt your strategy by broadening your search for entities, exploring different relationship types, or focusing on different aspects of the narrative (e.g., character motivations, setting changes).\n6.  **Information Synthesis:** Once relevant nodes and relationships are retrieved, synthesize the information to construct a coherent answer that addresses the user's query.\n\n**Function Usage:**\n\n*   Use `graph.find_nodes(query)` to discover nodes based on keywords, node types, or properties.\n*   Use `graph.get_neighbors(node_id, relationship_type)` to explore connections from a specific node.\n*   Use `graph.get_node_details(node_id)` to retrieve attributes of a node.\n*   Prefer broader searches initially (e.g., searching for common entity types or central nodes) before diving into specific details.\n*   Avoid overly specific or literal keyword searches that might miss indirectly represented information.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nIf a user asks \"What is the plot of the story?\", do", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 510 nodes and 907 relationships.

Your primary goal is to understand and extract narrative information, including the plot, characters, settings, and events.\n\n**Your Retrieval Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Narrative Context:** Before directly searching for specific plot points, aim to grasp the story's core elements.\n2.  **Identify Key Entities and Node Types:** Explore the graph to identify prominent node types (e.g., Person, Event, Location, Object) and the most central or frequently connected nodes within these types. This provides a foundation for understanding the story's components.\n3.  **Explore Relationships:** Analyze the relationships *between* identified entities. The plot is often revealed through sequences of events, character interactions, causal links, and thematic connections. Focus on relationships that indicate actions, motivations, or consequences (e.g., `PARTICIPATED_IN`, `CAUSED`, `TRAVELS_TO`, `INTERACTS_WITH`, `RELATES_TO`).\n4.  **Inferential and Pattern-Based Retrieval:** Do not rely on a single, literal keyword like \"plot.\" Instead, infer plot progression by piecing together connected events, character journeys, and the evolution of their states or relationships. Look for temporal sequences and causal chains.\n5.  **Adaptive Exploration:** If an initial exploration yields limited results, do not simply repeat the same query. Adapt your strategy by broadening your search for entities, exploring different relationship types, or focusing on different aspects of the narrative (e.g., character motivations, setting changes).\n6.  **Information Synthesis:** Once relevant nodes and relationships are retrieved, synthesize the information to construct a coherent answer that addresses the user's query.\n\n**Function Usage:**\n\n*   Use `graph.find_nodes(query)` to discover nodes based on keywords, node types, or properties.\n*   Use `graph.get_neighbors(node_id, relationship_type)` to explore connections from a specific node.\n*   Use `graph.get_node_details(node_id)` to retrieve attributes of a node.\n*   Prefer broader searches initially (e.g., searching for common entity types or central nodes) before diving into specific details.\n*   Avoid overly specific or literal keyword searches that might miss indirectly represented information.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nIf a user asks \"What is the plot of the story?\", do", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 510 nodes and 907 relationships.

Your primary goal is to understand and extract narrative information, including the plot, characters, settings, and events.\n\n**Your Retrieval Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Narrative Context:** Before directly searching for specific plot points, aim to grasp the story's core elements.\n2.  **Identify Key Entities and Node Types:** Explore the graph to identify prominent node types (e.g., Person, Event, Location, Object) and the most central or frequently connected nodes within these types. This provides a foundation for understanding the story's components.\n3.  **Explore Relationships:** Analyze the relationships *between* identified entities. The plot is often revealed through sequences of events, character interactions, causal links, and thematic connections. Focus on relationships that indicate actions, motivations, or consequences (e.g., `PARTICIPATED_IN`, `CAUSED`, `TRAVELS_TO`, `INTERACTS_WITH`, `RELATES_TO`).\n4.  **Inferential and Pattern-Based Retrieval:** Do not rely on a single, literal keyword like \"plot.\" Instead, infer plot progression by piecing together connected events, character journeys, and the evolution of their states or relationships. Look for temporal sequences and causal chains.\n5.  **Adaptive Exploration:** If an initial exploration yields limited results, do not simply repeat the same query. Adapt your strategy by broadening your search for entities, exploring different relationship types, or focusing on different aspects of the narrative (e.g., character motivations, setting changes).\n6.  **Information Synthesis:** Once relevant nodes and relationships are retrieved, synthesize the information to construct a coherent answer that addresses the user's query.\n\n**Function Usage:**\n\n*   Use `graph.find_nodes(query)` to discover nodes based on keywords, node types, or properties.\n*   Use `graph.get_neighbors(node_id, relationship_type)` to explore connections from a specific node.\n*   Use `graph.get_node_details(node_id)` to retrieve attributes of a node.\n*   Prefer broader searches initially (e.g., searching for common entity types or central nodes) before diving into specific details.\n*   Avoid overly specific or literal keyword searches that might miss indirectly represented information.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nIf a user asks \"What is the plot of the story?\", do", "user_prompt": "\nYour goal is to decide the next step of a strategy to explore a graph in order to retrieve relevant information to answer the following query: What is the plot of the story?.\n\nA high-level description of the graph is the following: This graph contains 510 nodes and 907 relationships.

However, it falls short of directly answering the user's core question about the \"plot of the story.\"\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Identifies relevant entities:** The response correctly identifies characters like the Invisible Man, Gurn, Misty Ones, Noork, Ud, and Vasads, suggesting it has processed some content related to these entities.\n*   **Extracts specific details:** It pulls out concrete actions and characteristics associated with these characters (e.g., instructions to Gurn, trapping Misty Ones, communication, invisible mantles). This shows it can extract factual information.\n*   **Acknowledges limitations:** The response is honest about its inability to provide the \"overall plot,\" which is crucial for managing user expectations.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Fails to synthesize into a narrative:** The core of the query is \"the plot of the story.\" The response provides a list of disconnected events and character interactions rather than a coherent narrative summary. It doesn't explain *why* these interactions are happening or what their purpose is within a larger storyline.\n*   **Assumes the retrieved information *is* the plot:** The response presents the extracted details as if they *could* constitute the plot, but then concludes it can't answer the question. This creates a slight contradiction. If these are the only details found, the system should explicitly state that it found *elements* but not a cohesive plot summary.\n*   **Lack of context:** The retrieved details are presented without any overarching context. We don't know the setting, the primary conflict, the goals of the characters, or the resolution.\n\n## Improvement Suggestions:\n\nHere are several ways to improve the RAG system's response, ranging from simple adjustments to more advanced retrieval strategies:\n\n### 1. Explicitly State What Was Found and What Was Missing (Enhanced Clarity)\n\nInstead of just saying \"I found information about...\" and then \"I could not find details regarding the overall plot...\", the system can be more precise.\n\n**Improved Response Example:**\n\n> \"I found information detailing specific events and character interactions within the story, including:\n>\n> *   The Invisible Man instructing Gurn not to fear demons.\n> *   The ability to trap and skin the Misty Ones.\n> *   Communication occurring between the Invisible Man, Noork, and Ud.\n> *   Vasads concealing themselves with invisible mantles.\n>\n> While these details provide glimpses into the world and its inhabitants, they do not form a cohesive summary of the *overall plot* or the main narrative arc of the story. Therefore, I cannot provide a complete plot description based on the information I was able to retrieve.\"\n\n### 2. Prioritize \"Plot\" Keywords in Retrieval (Retrieval Strategy)\n\nThe RAG system should be designed to prioritize documents or passages that explicitly discuss plot, summary, narrative, storyline, or overarching events. This might involve:\n\n*   **Document Chunking and Metadata:** If documents are chunked, chunks that contain summary-like language or are explicitly labeled as plot summaries should be given higher weight.\n*   **Query Expansion:** Expand the user's query with terms like \"summary,\" \"storyline,\" \"narrative,\" \"main events,\" \"what happens in the story,\" etc., to better match relevant content.\n*   **Document Ranking:** If the retrieval system ranks documents, it should favor those that are more likely to contain a plot summary.\n\n### 3. Synthesize Retrieved Snippets into a Narrative (Generation Strategy)\n\nIf the RAG system has access to multiple relevant snippets, it should attempt to weave them together into a more narrative form, even if it's fragmented.\n\n**How to achieve this:**\n\n*   **Identify a potential protagonist/antagonist:** Based on the frequency and nature of mentions, try to infer who the central figure(s) might be.\n*   **Look for causal relationships:** Are any of the retrieved actions a direct cause or effect of another?\n*   **Infer a conflict:** The mention of \"demons\" and \"trapping\" suggests potential conflict.\n*   **Add transitional phrases:** Use phrases like \"The story seems to involve...\", \"It appears that...\", \"Key elements include...\"\n\n**Example of attempting synthesis (even if incomplete):**\n\n> \"Based on the information retrieved, the story seems to involve the Invisible Man and his interactions with various beings. He appears to be giving instructions to Gurn, advising him on dealing with demons. There's also an indication of conflict or dominance over 'Misty Ones,' as they can be trapped and skinned. Furthermore, communication occurs between the Invisible Man, Noork, and Ud, suggesting these characters are part of the same narrative.
