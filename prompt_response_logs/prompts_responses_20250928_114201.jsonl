For instance, breaking it down into sections like \"Introduction,\" \"Conflict,\" and \"Climax\" could help readers understand the progression of the story better.\n\n2. **Details and Depth**: \n   - While the response mentions the main characters and their motivations, it lacks details about the emotional stakes or the journey's significance. Adding insights into the protagonist's background, motivations, and what drives them would enrich the plot summary.\n   - The explanation about how Doctor Von Mark's secret of invisibility directly impacts the story could be elaborated upon—what are the stakes if he succeeds?\n\n3. **Character Development**: \n   - More information about the characters, such as their traits, backstory, and relationships with each other, could enhance the reader's connection to them. For instance, what is Noork's relationship with the pilot, and why is the rescue of Tholon Sarna crucial?\n\n4. **Conflict and Themes**:\n   - Emphasize specific conflicts, both external (the fight against Doctor Von Mark) and internal (the pilot’s personal struggles or doubts). Highlighting themes—such as bravery, redemption, or the fight against evil—can give depth and context to the plot.\n\n5. **Conclusion/Resolution**:\n   - The response lacks a definitive conclusion or resolution to the plot. Summarizing how the storyline wraps up (or hinting at how it might resolve) would provide a fuller picture and allow readers to understand the overarching narrative arc.\n\n6. **ROUGE Score**: \n   - The relatively low ROUGE score suggests that the response might not have effectively captured key phrases and elements from a reference text or common understanding of the story.

The story takes the pilot from Greece to Africa and ultimately to a hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark is attempting to revive the remnants of Nazidom using a secret of invisibility.

The system prompt should emphasize the importance of clarity and brevity in the response. Phrasing like \"Provide a concise summary of the plot\" or \"Focus on the main events and characters without excessive detail\" should be included in the system prompt.\n\n2. **Focus on Key Elements**: While the answer provides a detailed description of the plot, it lacks a clear emphasis on the story's central conflict or themes. To improve this, the system prompt should specify that the answer should highlight key themes and the main conflict. For example, prompt the model with \"Identify the main conflict and thematic elements of the story.\"\n\n3. **Coherence and Flow**: The answer seems to jump between different elements of the plot without a clear narrative flow. This can confuse the user. The prompt should encourage a logical progression of events. For example, \"Present the plot in chronological order or in a logical sequence to maintain clarity.\"\n\n4. **Character Development**: While the answer mentions various characters, it does not provide sufficient insight into their motivations or significance regarding the plot. The system prompt might be improved by asking for a brief description of the characters' roles: \"Describe key characters and their relevance to the main plot.\"\n\n5. **Tone and Style**: The tone of the answer is somewhat formal, which may not align with the intended audience. The system prompt should encourage a tone that matches the user's expected reading level or interest. For instance, \"Use an engaging and accessible tone suitable for a broad audience.\"\n\n6. **Verification of Information**: There's a risk that the details included are inaccurate or inconsistent with the original text from which the chunks were derived. It is crucial for the prompt to advise checking for consistency with the source material. A phrasing like \"Ensure accuracy and alignment with the input text\" may help.\n\n7. **Feedback Integration**: Lack of feedback from the user can lead to repetitive mistakes. The prompt should encourage the system to incorporate previous feedback in the answer generation process.

Phrasing like \"Provide a concise summary of the plot\" or \"Focus on the main events and characters without excessive detail\" should be included in the system prompt.\n\n2. **Focus on Key Elements**: While the answer provides a detailed description of the plot, it lacks a clear emphasis on the story's central conflict or themes. To improve this, the system prompt should specify that the answer should highlight key themes and the main conflict. For example, prompt the model with \"Identify the main conflict and thematic elements of the story.\"\n\n3. **Coherence and Flow**: The answer seems to jump between different elements of the plot without a clear narrative flow. This can confuse the user. The prompt should encourage a logical progression of events. For example, \"Present the plot in chronological order or in a logical sequence to maintain clarity.\"\n\n4. **Character Development**: While the answer mentions various characters, it does not provide sufficient insight into their motivations or significance regarding the plot. The system prompt might be improved by asking for a brief description of the characters' roles: \"Describe key characters and their relevance to the main plot.\"\n\n5. **Tone and Style**: The tone of the answer is somewhat formal, which may not align with the intended audience. The system prompt should encourage a tone that matches the user's expected reading level or interest. For instance, \"Use an engaging and accessible tone suitable for a broad audience.\"\n\n6. **Verification of Information**: There's a risk that the details included are inaccurate or inconsistent with the original text from which the chunks were derived. It is crucial for the prompt to advise checking for consistency with the source material. A phrasing like \"Ensure accuracy and alignment with the input text\" may help.\n\n7. **Feedback Integration**: Lack of feedback from the user can lead to repetitive mistakes. The prompt should encourage the system to incorporate previous feedback in the answer generation process. For instance, \"Take into account feedback from previous iterations to improve upon the clarity and relevance of the answer.\"\n\nOverall, modifying the system prompt to address these issues will significantly enhance the quality of answers and ensure they meet user expectations more effectively.\n\nBased on this critique, generate a new system prompt that will be used to instruct the LLM how to better generate answers from retrieved vector information. The system prompt should incorporate the feedback to improve answer quality, relevance, and coherence.\n\nProvide only the optimized system prompt without additional commentary.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

The story takes the pilot from Greece to Africa and ultimately to a hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark is attempting to revive the remnants of Nazidom using a secret of invisibility. Throughout the journey, the pilot encounters various characters, including Noork, who is trying to rescue Tholon Sarna, a girl held captive in the city of Grath. Elements of adventure and conflict arise as the characters navigate treacherous landscapes and confront the unseen evil beings that threaten their friends and loved ones. The intertwining fates of the pilot, Von Mark, and Noork set the stage for a story filled with tension, peril, and the quest for rescue and redemption.\nEvaluation: \n\nBased on this single example, provide a detailed critique of how the retrieved content can be improved.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

Here’s a focused critique:\n\n1. **Relevance to Query**: The retrieved content lacks direct alignment with the central query regarding plot and character motivations. Excerpts featuring Noork’s interactions introduce unnecessary distraction, deviating from key plot elements related to Doctor Karl Von Mark and the American pilot. Future iterations should prioritize retrieving content explicitly connected to the query to ensure informative and relevant responses.\n\n2. **Coherence and Flow**: The disjointedness between different narrative chunks diminishes the reader’s ability to follow the storyline. For instance, abrupt transitions between characters and scenes disrupt the flow. Enhancing coherence by establishing clear connections between characters and their actions can help create a smoother narrative trajectory. Focused linking phrases or thematic consistency between chunks will improve readability.\n\n3. **Depth of Character Development**: While the excerpts hint at character motivations, they fail to provide sufficient emotional or psychological depth. Characters like Noork could benefit from richer backstories or motivations, making their decisions and actions more relatable and compelling. Future retrieval plans should prioritize content that sheds light on characters' inner conflicts and objectives.\n\n4. **Reduction of Redundancy**: Some retrieved passages repeat similar ideas or concepts, which not only dilute the narrative impact but also add unnecessary length. For instance, multiple references to the hidden valley do not provide new insights. Streamlining the content by eliminating redundant sections will create a more concise and engaging narrative.\n\n5. **Integration of Key Themes**: The overarching themes such as adventure, conflict, and redemption remain underexplored. The retrieved content should encapsulate these themes explicitly, drawing on key moments that reflect the stakes and emotional weight of the characters' quests. This thematic richness will enhance the narrative's resonance with readers.\n\n6. **Contextual Clarity**: Each retrieved chunk should clearly articulate its relationship to the main plot and characters. Improving contextual clarity will help readers better understand how each section integrates into the broader story, enhancing comprehension and engagement.\n\nIn summary, focusing on relevance, coherence, character exploration, thematic depth, and clarity in future retrievals can significantly elevate the quality of responses produced by the VectorRAG system.

This will help to piece together the overall narrative and clarify the character arcs and conflicts that have been hinted at in the earlier searches.\n\nThe critique on the retrieval plans was:\nThe retrieval plan exhibits some strengths, but there are significant areas for improvement to enhance relevance, coherence, and overall narrative depth. Here’s a focused critique:\n\n1. **Relevance to Query**: The retrieved content lacks direct alignment with the central query regarding plot and character motivations. Excerpts featuring Noork’s interactions introduce unnecessary distraction, deviating from key plot elements related to Doctor Karl Von Mark and the American pilot. Future iterations should prioritize retrieving content explicitly connected to the query to ensure informative and relevant responses.\n\n2. **Coherence and Flow**: The disjointedness between different narrative chunks diminishes the reader’s ability to follow the storyline. For instance, abrupt transitions between characters and scenes disrupt the flow. Enhancing coherence by establishing clear connections between characters and their actions can help create a smoother narrative trajectory. Focused linking phrases or thematic consistency between chunks will improve readability.\n\n3. **Depth of Character Development**: While the excerpts hint at character motivations, they fail to provide sufficient emotional or psychological depth. Characters like Noork could benefit from richer backstories or motivations, making their decisions and actions more relatable and compelling. Future retrieval plans should prioritize content that sheds light on characters' inner conflicts and objectives.\n\n4. **Reduction of Redundancy**: Some retrieved passages repeat similar ideas or concepts, which not only dilute the narrative impact but also add unnecessary length. For instance, multiple references to the hidden valley do not provide new insights. Streamlining the content by eliminating redundant sections will create a more concise and engaging narrative.\n\n5. **Integration of Key Themes**: The overarching themes such as adventure, conflict, and redemption remain underexplored. The retrieved content should encapsulate these themes explicitly, drawing on key moments that reflect the stakes and emotional weight of the characters' quests. This thematic richness will enhance the narrative's resonance with readers.\n\n6. **Contextual Clarity**: Each retrieved chunk should clearly articulate its relationship to the main plot and characters. Improving contextual clarity will help readers better understand how each section integrates into the broader story, enhancing comprehension and engagement.\n\nIn summary, focusing on relevance, coherence, character exploration, thematic depth, and clarity in future retrievals can significantly elevate the quality of responses produced by the VectorRAG system. Addressing these critical points will foster a more compelling and cohesive narrative that effectively meets user queries.\n\nBased on these contents, provide a detailed critique that will be used to improve the retrieval planning prompt.  \n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.
