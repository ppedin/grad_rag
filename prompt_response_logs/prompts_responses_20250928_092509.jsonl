A typical range for chunk sizes in token count can be anywhere from 50 to 150 tokens depending on the specific use case and the average length of potential responses. \\n\\nFor this scenario, where we are dealing with a straightforward question that seeks a summary, a chunk size of 100 tokens is optimal.

This will help ensure that the embeddings generated are informative and representative of the input while remaining computationally efficient. \\n\\nA chunk size of 100 tokens typically allows us to retrieve meaningful segments of text while minimizing the risk of breaking context too severely, which could happen if chunks are too small.
