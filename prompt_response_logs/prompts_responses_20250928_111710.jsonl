Here are several areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Coherent Summary**: The response fails to provide a clear and cohesive narrative arc. Instead of summarizing the plot in a structured way, it relies on fragmented details. To improve, the response should aim to string together these details into a logical and comprehensive overview of the story's progression, ideally including an introduction to key characters, motivations, and central conflicts.\n\n2. **Character Overview**: While the response mentions a character named Noork, it does not give enough context about him (e.g., his background or personality) or the significance of other characters like Tholon Sarna. Including brief character descriptions and their relationships to the plot would enhance understanding and depth.\n\n3. **Conflict and Themes**: The response mentions themes such as memory and identity but does not delve into how these themes play out within the plot. To improve, it could briefly explain how these themes are represented in the characters' actions or the story’s events, which would enrich the narrative context.\n\n4. **Specific Plot Details**: While the response indicates the presence of adventure and conflict, it does not provide specific events or scenarios that illustrate these elements. Adding more specific plot points, such as key events leading to Noork’s quest or particular challenges he faces, would enhance the engagement and clarity of the summary.\n\n5. **Overall Structure**: A well-organized response typically includes a beginning (setup), middle (confrontation), and end (resolution). The response lacks this structure, which leaves the reader without a clear understanding of how the story unfolds. Ensuring that the response reflects this structure can help convey a better sense of progression.\n\n6. **Improving ROUGE Score**: To increase the ROUGE score, the response should more closely parallel existing structured summaries found in literature regarding comprehensive summaries of plots, emphasizing critical phrases and key connections present in original texts.\n\nBy addressing these points, the response could provide a more rounded, detailed, and engaging summary of the story's plot that is both informative and compelling for the reader.", "system_prompt_length": 1091, "user_prompt_length": 65, "response_length": 2363, "metadata": {"rouge_score": 0.10385259631490787, "original_query_length": 30, "generated_answer_length": 783, "evaluation_length": 2363}}

Short chunks may lead to loss of coherence and result in vague or incomplete information retrieval, especially for complex narratives like plots in stories. Consider a larger chunk size, such as 50 or even 100, which may encapsulate entire paragraphs or key sections, providing richer context for the LLM to generate more accurate and relevant answers.\n\n2. **Overlap in Chunks**: If a chunk size is maintained at 25, it may be beneficial to implement overlapping chunks where subsequent chunks share some content. This approach can help mitigate context loss between adjacent chunks and ensure that plot developments spanning multiple chunks are adequately captured. Overlapping can allow the retrieval component to access crucial connections or transitions in the story more seamlessly.\n\n3. **Dynamic Chunking**: Instead of a fixed chunk size, implementing a dynamic chunking mechanism could enhance the system's performance. This would allow the chunk size to vary based on the text structure or content density. For instance, narrative-heavy sections could be retrieved in larger chunks, while more straightforward information could still be captured in smaller segments.\n\n4. **Contextual Relevance**: The critique suggests refining the retrieval query to obtain a summary or overview of events, which is valuable.

A collaborative approach, where the chunk size correlates with the type of information being queried, would enhance the relevance and richness of retrieved content. \n\n5. **User-Centric Queries**: Given that the queries can be refined further, experimenting with varying chunk sizes in A/B testing or during model training could yield insights into the optimal chunk size for various types of queries. Observations from these tests could inform more tailored adjustments to chunk sizes based on user patterns and the nature of the queries being asked.\n\nIn conclusion, while a chunk size of 25 is a starting point, it might lead to limitations in the context and detail provided during retrieval.

Consider a larger chunk size, such as 50 or even 100, which may encapsulate entire paragraphs or key sections, providing richer context for the LLM to generate more accurate and relevant answers.\n\n2. **Overlap in Chunks**: If a chunk size is maintained at 25, it may be beneficial to implement overlapping chunks where subsequent chunks share some content. This approach can help mitigate context loss between adjacent chunks and ensure that plot developments spanning multiple chunks are adequately captured. Overlapping can allow the retrieval component to access crucial connections or transitions in the story more seamlessly.\n\n3. **Dynamic Chunking**: Instead of a fixed chunk size, implementing a dynamic chunking mechanism could enhance the system's performance. This would allow the chunk size to vary based on the text structure or content density. For instance, narrative-heavy sections could be retrieved in larger chunks, while more straightforward information could still be captured in smaller segments.\n\n4. **Contextual Relevance**: The critique suggests refining the retrieval query to obtain a summary or overview of events, which is valuable. However, if the chunks are overly limited, even the refined queries may not yield sufficiently detailed answers. A collaborative approach, where the chunk size correlates with the type of information being queried, would enhance the relevance and richness of retrieved content. \n\n5. **User-Centric Queries**: Given that the queries can be refined further, experimenting with varying chunk sizes in A/B testing or during model training could yield insights into the optimal chunk size for various types of queries. Observations from these tests could inform more tailored adjustments to chunk sizes based on user patterns and the nature of the queries being asked.\n\nIn conclusion, while a chunk size of 25 is a starting point, it might lead to limitations in the context and detail provided during retrieval. Exploring larger sizes, overlap strategies, and dynamic chunking based on text complexity may significantly improve information retrieval and ultimately the answer quality generated by the LLM.\n\nBased on this critique, generate a new system prompt that will be used to instruct the LLM how to better determine optimal chunk sizes for vector construction. The system prompt should incorporate the feedback to improve hyperparameter reasoning and selection.\n\nProvide only the optimized system prompt without additional commentary.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Please limit your critique to approximately 512 tokens to ensure efficient inference processing.

When selecting chunk sizes, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Granularity vs. Comprehensiveness**: Evaluate the nature of the text being processed. For complex narratives or thematic content, larger chunk sizes (e.g., 50 or 100) may provide the necessary context for coherence, improving the quality of generated responses.\n\n2. **Chunk Overlap**: If opting for smaller chunk sizes, implement a strategy for overlapping content. This ensures that adjacent chunks maintain essential context, reducing the risk of losing critical narrative connections or transitions.\n\n3. **Dynamic Chunking Approach**: Shift from a fixed chunk size to a dynamic mechanism that adapts based on text structure and content density. This allows for larger chunks in narrative-heavy areas while still accommodating smaller sizes for straightforward sections.\n\n4. **Contextual Relevance**: Tailor retrieval queries to extract meaningful summaries or overviews that align closely with user information needs. Adjust chunk sizes based on the specific type of information being queried, ensuring that the retrieval captures the nuance required for detailed answers.\n\n5. **User-Centric Testing**: Implement iterative A/B testing to compare various chunk sizes across different query types. Analyze outcomes to identify patterns and inform more nuanced adjustments, enabling a chunk size selection that caters to diverse user queries and enhances overall system performance.\n\nYour responses should reflect these considerations to refine hyperparameter selection effectively, promoting better coherence, relevance, and detail in the information retrieved for end-user queries.", "system_prompt_length": 3447, "user_prompt_length": 42, "response_length": 1806, "metadata": {"critique_token_limit": 512, "prompt_length": 3288, "response_length": 1806}}
